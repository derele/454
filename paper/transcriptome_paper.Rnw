%% Background %%

\section*{Background}
 

The nematode Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara, Niimi et Itagaki, 1974
\cite{kuwahara_Niimi_Itagaki_1974} is a parasite of freshwater eels of
the genus Anguilla, and adults localise to the swim bladder where they
feed on blood. Larvae are transmitted via crustacean intermediate
hosts. Originally endemic to East-Asian populations of the Japanese
eel (Anguilla japonica), A. crassus has attracted interest due to
recent anthropogenic expansion of its geographic and host ranges to
Europe and the European eel (Anguilla anguilla). Recorded for the
first time in 1982 in North-West Germany \cite{fischer_teichwirt},
where it was most likely introduced through the live-eel trade
\cite{koops_anguillicola-infestations_1989, koie_swimbladder_1991},
A. crassus has spread rapidly through populations of its newly
acquired host \cite{kirk_impact_2003}. At the present day it is found
in all An. anguilla populations except those in Iceland
\cite{kristmundsson_parasite_2007}. A. crassus can be regarded as a
model for invasive parasite introduction and spread
\cite{taraschewski_hosts_2007}.

A. crassus has a major impact on An. anguilla populations. In its
natural host in Asia infection prevalence and mean intensity of
infection are lower than in Europe \cite{mnderle_occurrence_2006},
where high prevalence (above 70\% \cite{wrtz_distribution_1998}) and
high infection intesities have been reported throughout the newly
colonized area \cite{lefebvre_anguillicolosis:_2004}. The virulence of
A .crassus in this new host has been attributed to an inadequate
immune response in An. anguilla \cite{knopf_swimbladder_2006}. While
the An.  japonica is capable of killing larvae of the parasite after
vaccination \cite{knopf_vaccination_2008} or under high infection
pressure \cite{heitlinger_massive_2009}, responses in An. anguilla
have hallmarks of pathology, including thickening of the swim bladder
wall \cite{wrtz_histopathological_2000}.  Interestingly host also
affects the adult size and life-history of the nematodes: In European
eels the nematodes are bigger and develop and reproduce faster
\cite{knopf_differences_2004}.


The genus Anguillicola is placed in the nematode suborder Spirurina
(clade III sensu \cite{blaxter_molecular_1998})
\cite{nadler_molecular_2007, wijov_evolutionary_2006}. The Spirurina
are exclusively parasitic and include important human pathogens (the
causative agents of filariases and ascariasis) as well as prominent
veterinary parasites. Molecular phylogenetic analyses place
Anguillicola in a clade of spirurine nematodes (Spirurina B of
[Laetsch et al submitted]) that have an freshwater or marine
intermediate host, but infect a wide range of carnivorous definitive
hosts. Spirurina B is sister to the main Spirurina C, including the
agents of filariases and ascariasis), and thus A. crassus may be used
as an outgroup taxon to understand the evolution of parasitic
phenotypes in these species.

Recent advances in sequencing technology (often termed Next Generation
Sequencing; NGS), provide the opportunity for rapid and cost-effective
generation of genome-scale data. The Roche 454 platform
\cite{pmid16056220} offers longer reads than other NGS technologies,
and thus is suited to de novo assembly of genome-scale data in
previously understudied species. Roche 454 data has particular
application in transcriptomics \cite{pmid20950480}. The difference in
the biology of A. crassus in An. japonica (coevolved) and An. anguilla
(recently captured) eel hosts likely results from an interaction
between different host and parasite responses, underpinned by
definitive differences in host genetics, and possible genetic
differentiation between the invading European and endemic Asian
parasites. As part of aprogramme to understand the invasiveness of
A. crassus in An. anguilla, we are investigating differences in gene
expression and genetic distinction between invading European and
endemic Asian A. crassus exposed to the two different host
species. Here we report on the generation of a reference transcriptome
for A. crassus based on Roche 454 data, and explore patterns of gene
expression and diversity.

A total of \Sexpr{TRIM["total","raw_reads"]} raw sequencing reads were
generated for A. crassus (Table 1). These were trimmed for base call
quality, and filtered by length to give \Sexpr{TRIM["total","valid"]}
high-quality reads (XX bases). We then screened these reads for
contamination by host (30,071 matched previously sequenced eel genes
or our own An. anguilla 454 transcriptome), and for sequences derived
from ribosomal RNAs of the nematode (202,823 reads matched large or
small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA sequences of A. crassus) (Table
1). In addition to fish mRNAs, we identified (and removed) XXXX reads
in the library derived from the L2 nematodes that had significant
similarity to cercozoan (likely parasite) ribosomal RNA genes (Table
1).

In the eel data-set XXX reads matched for ribosomal RNA from
\textit{An. japonica} or \textit{An. anguilla} and were removed.

\subsection*{Assembly}

<<load.meth, echo=FALSE>>=
load("/home/ele/thesis/454/Method-assembly/Method.Rdata")

nMN <- nrow(contig.df[contig.df$category%in%"MN",])

nbad.c <- nrow(contig.df[contig.df$category%in%
                         c("M_n","N_n","N_1","M_1"),])

nSing <- nrow(contig.df[contig.df$category%in%0,])
@


We assembled the remaining \Sexpr{length(raw.fasta)} reads (spanning
\Sexpr{nBases} bases) using the combined assembler strategy
\cite{pmid20950480} and Roche 454 GSassembler (version 2.6) and MIRA
(version 3.01 XXX) \cite{miraEST}. From this we derived 13,851 contigs
that were supported by both assembly algorithms, 3,745 contigs only
supported by one of the assembly algorithms and 22,591 singletons that
were not assembled by either approach (****Table 2 or Figure
1****). When scored by matches to known genes, the contigs supported
by both assemblers are of the highest credibility, and this set is
thus termed the high credibility assembly (highCA). Those with
evidence from only one assembler are of medium credibility (medCA),
and the singletons are of lower credibility (lowCA). These datasets
are the most parsimonious (having the smallest size) for their quality
(covering the largest amount of sequence in reference
transcritomes). In the highCA parsimony and low redundancy is
prioritized, while in the complete assembly (highCA plus medCA plus
lowCA) completeness is proiritized. The 40187 sequences (contig
consensuses and singletons) in the complete assembly are referred to
below as tentatively unique genes (TUGs).

<<mean.cov, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE>>=

cov <- round(mean(con.pile[, "coverage"]),2)
cov.u <- round(mean(con.pile.uniq[, "uniq_coverage"]),2)
cov.mn <- round(mean(con.pile[con.pile$contig%in%
                                contig.df[contig.df$category=="MN", "contig"],
                                "coverage"]),2)
cov.mn.u <- round(mean(con.pile.uniq[con.pile.uniq$contig%in%
                                        contig.df[contig.df$category=="MN", "contig"],
                                        "uniq_coverage"]),2)

@ 

The mean per-base coverage of the TUGs was \Sexpr{cov} and the mean
per-base unique coverage was \Sexpr{cov.u}. The mean per-base coverage
of the quality contigs was lower with \Sexpr{cov.mn}, but the unique
coverage higher with \Sexpr{cov.mn.u}. This indicates a higher amount
of redundancy in the full assebmly set compared to the good-quality
set. The distribution of mean per base coverages for single contigs or
TUGs is given in Figure (coverage\_per\_contig.png)

\SweaveInput{../contamination/post_assembly.Rnw}

We screened the complete assembly for residual host contamination, and
identified 1,816 contigs that had higher, significant similarity to
eel (and fish) sequences (our 454 ESTs and EMBLBank fish proteins)
than to nematode sequences \cite{pmid21550347}. 

Given our prior identification of cercozoan ribosomal RNAs, we also
screened the complete assembly for contamination with other
transcriptomes, and

***describe what was found***

*** Now we want Table 2 describing the three datasets, with columns
highCA, medCA, lowCA, complete assembly, and rows initial contig
numbers, # fish contigs, # other contigs, # remaining contigs, span of
remaining contigs, number of reads total in contigs, mean base
coverage of contigs, number protein predictions derived in p4e, number
complete at 5', number complete at 3'', number with GO, number with
KEGG, number with EC, number with any blast to nematode, number with
any blast to anything ***

Our assembly thus has 38371

*** what is the number? - given as 31893 , 36166 later ***

TUGs spanning XY Mb (of which XYZ are highCA- or medCA-derived, and
span XY Mb) that are likely to derive from of A. crassus.

Protein prediction *** was this done for the fish and other biont
contigs? if so remove their numbers from this section *** For 39625
TUGs a protein was predicted using prot4EST [reference] (Table 2). The
full open reading frame was obtained for in 414 TUGs, while for 3304
the 5’ end and for 10178 the 3' end was complete. In 15988 TUGs the
corrected sequence with the imputed ORF was slightly changed compared
to the raw sequence.  Annotation We used annot8r [reference] to assign
gene ontology (GO) terms for 9569 TUGs, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers
for 3741 TUGs and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway annotations for 5990 TUGs (Table 2). Nearly one third (10274)
of the A. crassus TUGs were annotated with at least one identifier,
and 2854 had GO, EC and KEGG annotations (Figure
annotataionVenn.tiff). We compared our A. crassus GO annotations for
high-level GO-slim terms to the annotations (obtained the same way)
for the complete proteome of the filarial nematode Brugia malayi. The
partial transcriptome of A. crassus shows a remarkably similar
distribution

similar but is it remarkable? iis it sgnificantly different? is
C. elegans similar? what does this tell us about the completeness of

of GO-slim terms to the full proteome \textit{B. malayi} (figure
go_bm_com.png). We inferred presence of signal peptide cleavage sites
in the predicted protein sequence using SignalP \cite{pmid21959131}
predicted 1060 signal peptide cleavage sites and 83 signal peptides
with a transmembrane signature. *

\subsection*{Evolutionary conservation}
\SweaveInput{../conservation/conservation.Rnw}

Evolutionary conservation The A. crassus TUGs were classified as
conserved, conserved in Metazoa, conserved in Nematoda, conserved in
Spirurina or novel to A. crassus by comparing them to public databases
and using two BLAST bit-score cutoffs to define relatedness.

****Now describe the data, and reference table 3, add novel in
A. crassus****

\subsection*{Protein prediction}

\SweaveInput{../protein_prediction/imputed_from_p4EST.Rnw}

For in total
\Sexpr{nrow(contig.df[contig.df$method!="no-prediction",])#$} TUGs
a protein was predicted. A summary of protein prediction using the
different methods implemented in prot4EST is given in table 6.
 
The full open reading frame was obtained for in total
\Sexpr{nrow(imputed[imputed$full.length,])#$} TUGs, while for
\Sexpr{nrow(imputed[imputed$full.5p,])#$} the 5' end and for
\Sexpr{nrow(imputed[imputed$full.3p,])#$} the 3’ end was complete.  A
predicted ORF was defined at complete if it was starting with an
``atg''-start-codon, having at least 3 non-coding bases 5' of the
start-codon and having a ``tag'' (\Sexpr{stopcods["TAG"]}
observations), ``taa'' (\Sexpr{stopcods["TAA"]}) or ``tga''
(\Sexpr{stopcods["TGA"]}) stop-codon 3' of the ORF.

In addition to the protein-sequence used for annotation we obtained a
corrected nucleotide-sequence using the nucleotide equivalent of the
protein-prediction. This was necessary as \texttt{prot4Est} joins
high-scoring pairs from \texttt{blast}-searces introducing gaps (or
unknown fill-bases respectively) relative to the raw nucleotide
sequence if needed to obtain the correct frame for the ORF. In
\Sexpr{same.same[["FALSE"]]} TUGs the corrected sequence with the
imputed ORF was slightly changed compared to the raw sequence.
 
\subsection*{SNP analysis}
\label{sec:snp-analysis}

\SweaveInput{../snp_analysis/snp_analysis.Rnw}

In order to improve SNP-calling we screened a set of \Sexpr{nRawSnps}
candidate-SNPs predicted on in total \Sexpr{nbases} bases
(\Sexpr{nCov8bases} bases with a minimum coverage of more then 8-fold
available for SNP-calling). We first excluded SNPs predicted to be
present as more than 2 alleles and to undetermined (``N'') base in the
reference retaining \Sexpr{nReadSnps} SNPs. The ratio of transitions
(\Sexpr{tsv.read[[1]]}) to transversion (\Sexpr{tsv.read[[2]]}) in
this set was \Sexpr{round(tsv.read[[3]],2)} (ti/tv).

To further screen those SNPs we utilized observations made in
combination with protein prediction, i.e. with the inferred
open-reading frame. As noted above SNPs at unknown fill-bases had to
be disregarded, but the imputation of a continuous corrected ORF had
the advantage of making the coordinates for the ORF straight forward
to use.

\Sexpr{nReadOrf[["TRUE"]]} of the raw SNPs were predicted to be inside
an ORF, \Sexpr{nReadFrame[["1"]]} at a first positon in a codon,
\Sexpr{nReadFrame[["2"]]} on a second base and
\Sexpr{nReadFrame[["3"]]} on a third base in a codon.

As expected ti/tv inside ORFs was with
\Sexpr{tsv.read.orf["TRUE","ratioTS.TV"]} higher than outside ORFs
with \Sexpr{tsv.read.orf["FALSE","ratioTS.TV"]}.

To asses the effect of a mutation at a given base we used an idea of
Mark Blaxter (unpublished, some information at \cite{Marks_ontology}),
to classify every base as to its ``response'' to mutation. We used
this classification to compute the number of synonymous and
non-synonymous sites in a given TUG. In total \Sexpr{total.nsyn}
non-synonymous and \Sexpr{total.syn} sites were found in ORFs, of
these \Sexpr{round(total.cov8.nsyn,2)} non-synonymous sites and
\Sexpr{round(total.cov8.syn,2)} synonymous sites were covered at
least 8-fold, and thus available for SNP-calling.

For the raw set of candidate-SNPs the ratio of synonymous
polymorphisms per synonymous site to non-synonymous polymorphisms per
non-synonymous site (dn/ds) was \Sexpr{round(read.dn.ds, 2)}.

To improve SNP-calling with respect to the well-known homopolymer
issues in 454-sequencing\cite{pmid21685085}, we analysed the effect of
exclusion of SNPs in, or close to, homopolymer regions. We observed
changes in ti/tv and in dn/ds when SNPs were discareded due to
different sizes thresholds for homoploymer-runs and different
proximity thresholds (see figure snp\_ex\_parameter\_plots.png). Based
on this we decided to exclude SNPs with a homopolymer-run as long as
or longer than 4 bases inside a window of 11 bases (5 to bases to the
right, 5 to the left) around the SNP.

After these screening steps based on a sequence-features we
investigated the effect of data volume and mapping on the remaining
candidate SNPs. Based on a slight overrepresentation of SNPs on first-
and second-positions in the ORF and on a little bigger than average
excess of non-synonymous polymorphisms in SNPs with a percentage of
the minority allele smaller than 7\% (see figure
snp\_pos\_eff\_plots.png a and b) we examined exclusion of SNPs at
this percentage threshold. Evaluation of an exclusion of SNPs based on
coverage at the SNP-site, did not seem necessary (see figure
snp\_pos\_eff\_plots.png c and d).

Table 7 gives on overview of how the basic SNP-statistics described
above changed with screening of the candidate SNPs. The change of
ti/tv back to lower values, when SNPs were screened based on a 7\%
coverage threshold, left the benefit of this screening-step
questionable.

However, calculating dn/ds on a per contig base, the screening based
on percentage threshold of the minority-allele showed it's benefits:
figure dn\_ds\_scales.png b shows how for the unscreened SNP-set dn/ds
scaled with the coverage of a contig. This correlation was not longer
present if the percentage screening was used (see figure
dn\_ds\_scales.png d, the linear model had a slightly negative
non-significant slope). For both the screened and unscreened sets of
SNPs there was a significant slope for the number of SNPs in a contig
predicting dn/ds (see figure dn\_ds\_scales.png a and c).

Figure dens\_dn\_ds.png gives the distribution of per-contig dn/ds for
the fully screened set of SNPs. The final numbers of SNPs per
kilo-base was \Sexpr{round(perc.per.cov8.b,2)},
\Sexpr{round(s.per.s.cov8.base,2)} synonymous SNPs per 1000 synonymous
bases and \Sexpr{round(n.per.n.cov8.base, 2)} non-synonymous SNPs per
1000 non-synonymous bases. For a total of
\Sexpr{nrow(subset(contig.df,!is.na(dn.ds)))} TUGs
(\Sexpr{nrow(subset(contig.df,!is.na(dn.ds)&category%in%"MN"))} high
  quality contigs) a value for dn/ds could be obtained, because at
  least one synonymous SNP was found.

  It should be noted that the overall dn/ds value of
  \Sexpr{perc.dn.ds} is different from the mean dn/ds value of contigs
  \Sexpr{round(mean(contig.df$dn.ds, na.rm=TRUE),2)#$}, as in the
  first the complete length of the sequence (also from TUGs without
  synonymous SNP predicted) can be included.

\subsection*{Annotation}

\SweaveInput{../annotation/annotation.Rnw}
\SweaveInput{../annotation/read_signalp.Rnw}

We obtained annotations with GO-terms for \Sexpr{nGO}, with EC-numbers
for \Sexpr{nEC} and with KEGG-pathways for \Sexpr{nKEGG} TUGs using
the \texttt{Blast}-based program annot8r.

Figure (annotataionVenn.tiff) gives an overview of the
\Sexpr{nallannotations} TUGs annotations were found for with
different methods.

\SweaveInput{../annotation/brugia-compare.Rnw}

We compared GO-annotations for high-level GO-slim terms to the
annotations obtained the same way for all \textit{B. malayi}-proteins:
Our transcriptome for \textit{A. crassus} shows a remarkably similar
distribution of GO-terms to the full set of annotations for the genome
of the related nematode (see figure go\_bm\_com.png).

In addition we inferred presence of signal peptide cleavage sites in
the predicted protein sequence: \texttt{SignalP} \cite{pmid21959131}
predicted \Sexpr{nsigP} signal peptide cleavage sites and
\Sexpr{nsigPtm} signal peptides with a transmembrane signature.

\subsection*{Consolidated results}

\SweaveInput{../snp_analysis/overrepresentation.Rnw}

The following set of analyses, represetnt enrichment analysis where
the ``gene-universe'' to test against has to be defined. Possible
off-target sequences were excluded prior to analysis. Testing was
performed against a universe of only TUGs we were sure to be of
\textit{A. crassus}-origin.

\subsubsection*{Signal-positives have higher dn/ds}

TUGs predicted to contain signal peptide cleavage sites by the
neural-networks method in \texttt{SignalP} have higher dn/ds values
than TUGs without signal peptide cleavage sites (p =
\Sexpr{round(u.test.AC[["p.value"]], 3)}; one sided U-test; see also
figure sigp\_dn\_ds.png).

\subsubsection*{Enrichment of GO-categories in high dn/ds}

We defined TUGs with a dn.ds higher than 0.5 as positively selected
and tested each node-term in the ontology for a over-representation in
this set. Tables X give an overview of enriched terms for different
parts of the ontology.

The terms ``amino acid transmembrane transporter activity'' and
``peptidase activity'' were among the overrepresented terms for
``molecular function''. Underrepresented were on the other hand terms
associated with ribosomal proteins and transcription (visible in
``molecular function'' and ``cellular compartment'') .

TODO: BP and CC over-representation. 

To make sure these inferences were not biased by redundancy in the
fullest data-set we repeated the analysis using only the good-quality
contigs as gene-universe. The results showed to be consistent with
those obtained for the fullest data-set (data not shown).

\subsubsection*{Novel in cladeIII have elevated dn/ds}

Figure conservation\_dn\_ds.png shows differences in dn/ds across the
categories defined for evolutionary conservation. At a bitscore
threshold of 80 sequences novel in clade III had a significantly
higher dn/ds than other sequences (p =
\Sexpr{round(u.novel.80[["p.value"]],3)}; two sided U-test). At a
bitscore thershold of 50 results were non-significant but showed the
same trend.

\subsubsection*{Sequences novel in nematodes are enriched for
  Signal-positives}

Figure signal\_novel.png gives the proportions of
\texttt{SignalP}-predictions for each category of evolutionary
conservation. Generally - across bit-score thresholds - sequences
novel in nematodes contained the highest proportion of
signal-positives.

\subsection*{Differential expression}
                
\SweaveInput{../gene_expression/gene_expression.Rnw}

Using methods developed for sequencing data, we analyzed
gene-expression inferred from mapping. Of the \Sexpr{n454.map} reads
mapping to the fullest assembly \Sexpr{n454.Umap} mapped uniquely
(with their best hit) and were counted on a per library base.

\subsection*{Comparison with tag-sequencing pilot data-set}

\SweaveInput{../solexa_compare/solexa_compare.Rnw}

\Sexpr{nMapped} of \Sexpr{nTags} (\Sexpr{nUniq} unique) NlaIII-tags
mapped to the fullest assembly. Only \Sexpr{nUMapped}
(\Sexpr{nUniqUMapped} unique) tags did not map to any sequence in the
fullest assembly.

Table 9a gives correlations coefficients between tag-counts and
454-libraries. Correlations-coefficients between 454-libraries were
generally low, indicating a high proportion of noise or biological
differences between samples. Correlation between expression-tags and
454-read counts were even lower. However when only analyzing counts to
good-quality contigs, correlation coefficients improved both between
libraries and between 454-libraries and solexa-tags (see table 9b). No
further improvements were made, when counts were limited to contigs
surely \textit{A. crassus} (see table 9c). Correlations between
library T2 and other 454-libraries, as well as with solexa-tag counts
were lower than between other libraries.

To gain power in statistical analysis we limited the set of
gene-objects analyzed for differential expression to the good-quality
contigs.

\subsubsection*{Differential expression between male and female worms}

Despite the lack of replicates for male worms we were able to identify
\Sexpr{length(sig.mf.contigs)} sequences being significantly
over-expressed in male worms. In fact all these TUGs were nearly
exclusively expressed in males. 

\subsubsection*{Differential expression between adults and L2-larvae}

For the L2-library we changed our approach and used gene-expression
analysis rather to highlight the off-target data in this library. For
this reason we used counts for the fullest assembly.

\Sexpr{length(sig.ad.contigs)} sequences being expressed exclusively
in L2 library were strongly enriched in sequences being labeled as
possible off-target data in taxonomic classification. From these
sequences only \Sexpr{l2.met.hits} had best hits to metazoa and only
\Sexpr{l2.nem.hits} to nematoda.

\subsubsection*{Differential expression between worms from the European
  and Japanese eel}

None of the TUGs in the present evaluation showed significant
differential expression between worms from the European and Japanese
Eel. Diagnostic plots provided by \texttt{DESeq} made clear, that both
depth of sequencing and number of replicates have to be higher
contrasting these conditions.

However, comparing expression-analysis on the full data-set to analysis
limited to the high quality of reliable \textit{A. crassus}-contigs it
was clear that the quality-data-set reduces within-condition variance
and results were closer to significance: The lowest adjusted p-values
for the cleaned data-set were around 0.4, while on the full data-set
only adjusted p-values above 0.8 could be obtained.

\subsection*{Secreted immunomodulatory molecules}

immunumodulators. Should I???

\section*{Discussion}

We have generated a de novo transcriptome for A. crassus an important
invasive parasite that threatens wild stocks of the European eel
An. anguilla. These data enable a broad spectrum of molecular research
on this ecologically and economically important parasite. As
A. crassus lives in close association with its host, we have used
exhaustive filtering to attempt to remove all host-derived, and
host-associated organism-derived contamination from the data. To do
this we have also generated a transcriptome dataset from the
definitive host An. japonica. The non-nematode, non-eel data
identified, particularly in the L2 sample, showed highest identity to
flagellate protists, which may have been parasitising the eel (or the
nematode). Encapsulated objects observed in eel swim bladder walls
\cite{heitlinger_massive_2009} could be due solely to immune attrition
of A. crassus larvae or to other coinfections.

A second examination of sequence origin was performed after assembly,
employing higher stringency cutoffs.  Similar taxonomic screening was
used in a garter snake transcriptome project \cite{pmid21138572}, and
an analysis of lake sturgeon tested and rejected hypotheses of
horizontal gene-transfer when xenobiont sequences were identified
\cite{pmid20386959}. A custom pipeline for transcriptome assembly from
pyrosequencing reads \cite{pmid20034392} proposed the use of EST3
\cite{pmid17218127} to infer sequence origin based simply on
nucleotide frequency. We were not able to use this approach
successfully, probably due to the fact that xenobiont sequences in our
data set derive from multiple sources with different GC content and
codon usage.

Compared to other NGS transcriptome sequencing projects
[references???], the combined assembly approach generated a smaller
number of contigs that had lower redundancy and higher
completeness. Projects using the mira assembler often report
substantially greater numbers of contigs for datasets of similar size
(see e.g. \cite{pmid21364769}), comparable to the mira sub-assembly in
our approach. The use of oligo(dT) to capture mRNAs probably explains
the bias towards 3' end completeness and a relative lack of true
initiation codons in our protein prediction. This bias is
near-ubiquitous in deep transcriptome sequencing projects
(e.g. \cite{pmid20331785}).

We generated transcriptome data from multiple A. crassus of Taiwanese
and European origin, and identified SNPs both within and between
populations. Screening of SNPs in or adjacent to homopolymer regions
improved overall measurements of SNP quality. The ratio of transitions
to transversions (ti/tv) increased. Such an increase is explained by
the removal of “noise” associated with common homopolymer errors
[27]. The value of 2.38 (1.82 outside, 2.74 inside ORFs) is in good
agreement with the overall ti/tv of humans (2.16 \cite{pmid21169219})
or Drosophila (2.07 \cite{pmid21143862}). The ratio of non-synonymous
SNPs per non-synonymous site to synonymous SNPs per synonymous site
(dn/ds) decreased with removal of SNPs adjacent to homopolymer regions
from 0.45 to 0.32 after full screening. The most plausible explanation
is the removal of error, as unbiased error would lead to a dn/ds of
1. While dn/ds is not unproblematic to interpret within populations
\cite{pmid19081788}, the assumption of negative (purifying) selection
on most protein-coding genes makes lower mean values seem more
plausible. We used a threshold value for the minority allele of 7\%
for exclusion of SNPs, based on an estimate that approximately 10
haploid equivalents were sampled (5 individual worms plus an
negligible contribution from L2 larvae in the L2 library and within
the female adult worms). The benefit of this screening was mainly a
reduction of non-synonymous SNPs in high coverage contigs, and a
removal of the dependence of dn/ds on coverage. Working with an
estimate of dn/ds independent of coverage, efforts to control for
sampling a biased by sampling depth (i.e. coverage; see
\cite{pmid18590545} and \cite{pmid20478048} ) could be avoided.


 


***
When the whole of coding sequences are studied, of which only a small
subset of sites can be under diversifying selection, dn/ds of ~0.5 has
been suggested as threshold for assuming diversifying selection
\cite{pmid15579698} instead of the classical threshold of 1
\cite{pmid6449605}. In the transcripts from the female reproductive
tract of \textit{Drosophila} dn/ds was 0.15 \cite{pmid15579698} and in
the 0.21 male reproductive tract \cite{pmid11404480} (although for ESTs
specific to the male accessory gland were shown to have a higher dn/ds
of 0.47). Pyrosequencing studies found dn/ds to be between 0.13 and
0.27 (depending on tissue type genes were mainly expressed in) in the
Zebra finch transcriptome \cite{pmid20359325}, 0.12 in the
transcriptome of \textit{Tigriopus californicus} \cite{pmid21199025}
and 0.3 in the parasitic nematode \textit{Ancylostoma canium}
\cite{pmid20470405}. In comparison with these results even our
estimate after screening seems high (although it should be noted, that
the latter tree studies report a mean dn/ds over contigs - the
\textit{A. canium} doesn't make clear what exactly is reported - and
therefore the value has to be compared to our mean dn/ds over contigs
of \Sexpr{round(mean(contig.df$dn.ds,na.rm=TRUE),2)#$}) and further
investigation using deeper sequencing of more individuals on the
solexa GAII platform will be used to fully exclude the possibility of
this result being induced by sequencing error. Moreover such an
experiment should try to test that divergence between populations is
leading to positive selection on only the possibly diverging European
populations. For such a study the set of SNPs found here are
invaluable, as it can be used to define a gold standard set of SNPs
found with both technologies.

We were able to obtain high-quality annotations for a large set of
TUGs. Comparison with protein sequence derived from \textit{B. malayi}
showed a a remarkable degree of agreement regarding the occurrence of
terms. This implies, that our transcriptome-data-set is a
representative subset of a nematode-parasite
genome. 

Over-representation of GO-term in genes under diversifying selection
(at a threshold of dn/ds>0.5, as established above) highlighted many
interesting gene-products:

In the molecular function category two amino acid transmembrane
transporters (``Contig5699'' and ``Contig866'') - the only contigs
with this annotation (or annotation, which is an offspring-term of
this) and a dn/ds obtained - were found to have a dn/ds>0.5. Such
transporter are thought to be important in the survival of parasites in
a host \cite{pmid18272295}.

Enrichment in the category ``peptidase activity'' highlighted twelve
peptidases (from 43 with a dn/ds obtained). All twelve have orthologs
in \textit{B. malayi} and \textit{C. elgans} and are conserved across
kingdoms. Despite their conservation peptidases are thought to have
have acquired new and prominent roles in host-parasite interaction
compared to free living organisms: In \textit{A. crassus} a
trypsin-like proteinase has been identified thought to be utilized by
the tissue-dwelling L3 stage to penetrate host tissue and an aspartyl
proteinase thought to be a digestive enzyme in adults
\cite{polzer_identification_1993}.

The under-representation of ribosomal proteins (term ``structural
constituent of ribosome'') in disruptively selected contigs is in good
agreement with the notion that ribosomal proteins are extremely
conserved across kingdoms \cite{pmid9664699} and should be under under
strong negative selection. 

The additional prediction of signal sites for cleavage allowed
interpretation and cross-validation of the results from SNP-calling:
The detection of signal-peptides secretion using \textit{in silico}
analysis of ESTs has been used to highlight candidate genes for
example in \textit{Nippostrongylus brasiliensis}
\cite{harcus_signal_2004} and in a large scale analysis across all
nematode \cite{nagaraj_needles_2008} ESTs. Proteomic analysis in
\textit{B. malayi} \cite{pmid19352421,pmid18958170} and
\textit{Heligmosomoides polygyrus} \cite{pmid21722761} was able to
find evidence for excretion for some of the protein-products and to
highlight additional candidate genes.

We found an elevated dn/ds for signal-positives. These result could be
explained follow the logic of signal-positives being more likely to be
secreted to the host-parasite interface and proteins involved in
host-parasite interaction being more likely to be under disruptive
selection. Signal-positive TUGs with high dn/ds constitute another set
of genes worth further examination in future studies.

TUGs predicted to be novel in the phylum nematoda contained the
highest proportion of signal-positives. A interpretation of this
findings could be a confirmation of a study on \textit{Nippostrongylus
  brasiliensis} \cite{harcus_signal_2004}, where signal positives were
reported as less conserved. In the present study we did not aim to
identify ``novelty to \textit{A. crassus}'' as we believe in a deep
sequencing project he absence of sequence similarity could be
attributed to erroneous sequence instead of true novelty, and thereby
blur analysis. However novelty in nematodes and to a lesser extend
novelty in Spirurina seems to support the notion, that - if not
diversified within nematoda to an extend leading to a complete loss of
similarity, like suggested in the mentioned study - signal positives
in nematodes could have taken a divergent evolutionary path from their
orthologs in other phyla.

It was within our expectation, that expression analysis failed to give
conclusive results, as the present data-set is not fully adequate for
this kind of analysis: First we did not include replicates for
libraries of male adults as well as for L2-larvae. Second one of the
replicates for female worms (library E1) resulted in a low amount of
sequence mappable to protein-coding (non-rRNA) genes.
However some of the results are still valuable:

DESeq was able to report genes significantly differing in expression
between male and female worms and between the L2 library and the all
other worms. This was possible for male worms as well as for
L2-larvae, were no replicated samples were obtained, due due the
special features of this package \cite{pmid20979621}. However only
over-expression in non-repeated samples can be detected, as obviously
lack of expression in one sample can't validate

Comparisons were lacking significance, as methods are designed for
deeper sequencing and more importantly more replicates would be
needed. Differences between the L2-library and other libraries were
mainly due to off-target data, and TUGs solely found in the L2 library
are ...

\section*{Methods}


\subsection*{Nematode samples, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Sequencing}

\textit{A. crassus} from \textit{JAn. japonica} were sampled from
Kao-Ping river and an adjacent aquaculture in Taiwan as described in
\cite{heitlinger_massive_2009}. Worms from An. anguilla were sampled
in Sniardwy Lake, Poland (53.751959N, 21.730957E) and from the
Linkenheimer Altrhein, Germany (49.0262N, 8.310556E). After
determination of the sex of adult nematodes, they were stored in
RNA-later (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) until extraction of RNA. RNA was
extracted from individual adult male and female nematodes and from a
population of L2 larvae (Table 1). RNA was reverse transcribed and
amplified into cDNA using the MINT-cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia).  For host contamination screening a liver-sample from
an uninfected A. japonica was also processed.  Emulsion PCR was
performed for each cDNA library according to the manufacturer’s
potocols (Roche/454 Life Sciences), and sequenced on a Roche 454
Genome Sequencer FLX. All samples were sequenced using the FLX
Titanium chemistry, except for the taiwanese female sample T2, which
was sequenced using FLX standard chemistry, to generate between 99,000
and 209,000 raw reads. For the L2 larval library, which had a larger
number of non-A. crassus, non-An. anguilla reads, we confirmed that
these data were not laboratory contaminants by screening Roche 454
data produced on the same run in independent sequencing lanes.


\subsection*{Trimming, quality control and assembly}

Raw sequences were extracted in fasta format (with the corresponding
qualities files) using sffinfo (Roche/454) and screened for adapter
sequences of the MINT-amplification-kit using cross-match \cite{PHRAP}
(with parameters -minscore 20 and -minmatch 10). Seqclean
\cite{tgicl_pertea} was used to identify and remove poly-A-tails, low
quality, repetitive and short (<100 base) sequences. All reads were
compared to a set of screening databases using BLAST (expect value
cutoff E<1e-5, low complexity filtering turned off: -F F). The
databases used were (a) a host sequence database comprising an
assembly of the An. japonica Roche 454 data, an unpublished assembly
of An. anguilla Sanger dideoxy sequencesd expressed sequence tags
(made available to us by Gordon Cramb, University of St Andrews) and
transcripts from from EeelBase \cite{pmid21080939} a publically
availble transcriptome database for the European eel; (b) a database
of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences from eel species derived from our
Roche 454 data and EMBL-Bank; and (c) a database of rRNA sequences
identified in our A. crassus data by comparing the reads to known
nematode rRNAs from EMBL-Bank. This last database notably also
contained xenobiont rRNA sequences. Reads with matches to one of these
databases over more than 80\% of their length and with greater than
95\% identity were removed from the dataset. Screening and trimming
information was written back into sff-format using sfffile (Roche
454). The filtered and trimmed data were assembled using the combined
assembly approach \cite{pmid20950480}, combining assemblies from the
mira \cite{miraEST} and newbler \cite{pmid16056220}. ****Give the
details here and we will trim the text later **** . The two assemblies
were combined into one using Cap3 \cite{Cap3_Huang} at default
settings and contigs labeled by whether they derived from both
assemblies or one assembly only.

\subsection*{Post-assembly classification and taxonomic assignment of
  contigs}

After assembly contigs were assessed a second time for host and other
contamination by comparing them (using BLAST) to the three databases
defined above, and also to nembase4, a nematode transcriptome database
derived from whole genome sequencing and EST assemblies
\cite{parkinson_nembase:resource_2004, pmid21550347}. For each contig,
the highest-scoring match was recorded as long as it spanned more than
50\% of the contig. We also compared the contigs to the NCBI
non-redundant nucleotide (NCBI-nt) and protein (NCBI-nr) databases,
recording the taxonomy of all best matches with expect values better
than 1e-05.

\subsection*{Protein prediction and annotation}


Protein translations were predicted from the contigs using prot4EST
(version 3.0b) \cite{wasmuth_prot4est:_2004}. Proteins were predicted
either by joining single high scoring segment pairs (HSPs) from a
BLAST search of uniref100 \cite{pmid18836194}, or by ESTscan
\cite{estscan}, using a training data the \textit{Brugia malayi}
complete proteome back-translated using a codon usage table derived
from the BLAST HSPs, or, if the first two methods failed, simply the
longest ORF in the contig. For contigs where the proein prediction
required insertion or deletion of bases in the original sequence, we
also imputed an edited sequence for each affected contig. Annotations
with Gene Ontology (GO), Enzyme Commission (EC) and Kyoto
Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms were inferred for
these proteins using Annot8r (version 1.1.1)
\cite{schmid_annot8r:_2008}, using the annotated sequences available
in uniref100 \cite{pmid18836194}. Up to 10 annotations based on a
BLAST similarity bitscore cut-off of 55 were obtained for each
annotation set. The complete \textit{B. malayi} proteome (as present
in uniref100) and the complete \textit{C. elegans} proteome (as
present in wormbase v.220) were also annotated in the same
way. SignalP V4.0 \cite{pmid21959131} was used to predict signal
peptide cleavage sites and signal anchor signatures.

\subsection*{Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis}

We mapped the raw reads against the the complete set of contigs,
replacing imputed sequences for originals where relevant, using ssaha2
(with parameters -kmer 13 -skip 3 -seeds 6 -score 100 -cmatch 10
-ckmer 6 -output sam -best 1). From the ssaha2 output, pileup-files
were produced using samtools
\cite{journals/bioinformatics/LiHWFRHMAD09}, discarding reads mapping
to multiple regions. VarScan \cite{pmid19542151} (pileup2snp) was used
with default parameters on pileup-files to output lists of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their locations.

% \subsection*{Respiration analysis}

% We extracted contigs annotated with ``GO:0009060 aerobic respiration''
% and ``GO:0009061 anaerobic respiration''

\subsection*{Gene-expression analysis}

For Roche 454 data, read counts for each transcript were obtained from
the mapping to imputed sequence performed for SNP
analyses. Tag-sequences were mapped using BWA \cite{pmid19451168}. And
read counts extracted using Samtools
\cite{journals/bioinformatics/LiHWFRHMAD09}. For deepSAGE
NlaIII-tag-sequencing, total RNA was prepared as described above from
a female nematode from the Polish sampling site. A deepSAGE library
was constructed following the protocol supplied by Illumina. Briefly
after synthesis of cDNA on oligo(dT)-beads, cDNA was digested with the
NlaIII (recognition site CATG), and the oligo(dT)-anchored 3' ends of
mRNAs retained. After ligation of an adaptor containing an MmeI
restriction site, the type II enzyme MmeI was used to cut 17 bases
from the 3' end fragment, genrating a 21 base tag, expected to be
unique for most mRNAs. The R-package DESeq \cite{pmid20979621} was
used to normalize for library size and analyse statistical
significance of differential expression of both Roche 454 and deepSAGE
data. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for raw
counts.

\subsection*{General coding methods}

The bulk of analysis (unless otherwise cited) presented in this paper
was carried out in R \cite{R_project} using custom scripts. We used a
method provided in the R-packages
Sweave\cite{lmucs-papers:Leisch:2002} and Weaver\cite{weaver} for
``reproducible research'' combining R and \TeX code in a single
file. All intermediate data files needed to compile the present
manuscript from data-sources are provided upon request. For
visualistaion we used the R-packages lattice\cite{lattice-book} and
ggplot2\cite{ggplot-book}.
