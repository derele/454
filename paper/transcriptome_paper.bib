		  have been successful in defining gene functions in the

		  Here we describe the use of RNA interference to inhibit the

		  genes of C. elegans. We identified mutant phenotypes for
		  1,722 genes, about two-thirds of which were not previously
		  associated with a phenotype. We find that genes of similar
		  functions are clustered in distinct, multi-megabase regions
		  of individual chromosomes; genes in these regions tend to
		  share transcriptional profiles. Our resulting data set and
		  reusable RNAi library of 16,757 bacterial clones will
		  facilitate systematic analyses of the connections among

		  different tissues and, in addition, the activity as
		  measured with acetoacetyl-CoA (but not with other
		  longer-carbon-chain acyl-CoA substrates) was activated by
		  K(+). 2. These properties were due to the presence, in
		  different proportions in each tissue, of three classes of
		  thiolase, all of which use acetoacetyl-CoA as substrate but
		  which have different intracellular locations and substrate
		  specificities and which differ also in kinetic and
		  chromatographic behaviour. 3. Cytoplasmic thiolase activity
		  was found to be widely distributed among different tissues
		  and was due to an acetoacetyl-CoA-specific thiolase. This
		  cytoplasmic activity was found to account for a significant
		  proportion of the total tissue activity towards
		  acetoacetyl-CoA in several tissues, and especially in the
		  brain of newborn rats. 4. Mitochondrial thiolase activity
		  towards acetoacetyl-CoA was due to two different classes of
		  enzyme whose relative amounts varied with the tissue type.
		  An oxoacyl-CoA thiolase of general specificity for the
		  acyl-CoA substrate constituted one class, the other being a
		  specific acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase that differed from its
		  cytoplasmic counterpart in being greatly stimulated by
		  K(+). 5. This activation by K(+) made it possible to

		  acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and mitochondrial oxoacyl-CoA
		  thiolase from measurements of activity with acetoacetyl-CoA
		  in tissue extracts under defined conditions. 6. The

		  explores a possible explanation for why conflicts of

		  contrast to most other evolutionary contexts in which
		  conflicts of interest are thought to have been important,
		  sexual reproduction usually involves an extensive,
		  irretrievable mixing of the genomes of the participants.
		  Under certain combinations of costs and benefits to

		  through increased reproduction of her offspring, from the
		  very genes that produce sexually antagonistic traits in the
		  male. In short, females can sometimes gain by "losing."
		  Such Fisherian payoffs are also possible, though probably
		  less important, for males. Gaining by losing is not
		  feasible in most other contexts of evolutionary conflict,
		  except under some conditions in parent-offspring conflict.
		  Some apparent parent-offspring conflicts may instead be
		  parental choice among offspring that is analogous to
		  traditional female choice. Parent-offspring conflict may be
		  relatively common, however, because offspring manipulation

		  pyrethroid resistant laboratory strain and a pyrethroid
		  susceptible field strain from Mali.\\ USING A POOL OF LIFE
		  STAGES (PUPAE, LARVAE, ADULTS: females and males) for each
		  strain, 454 sequencing generated 375,619 reads (average
		  length of 182 bp). De novo assembly generated 18,103

		  sequencing of the field strain generated 204,758 reads
		  compared to 170,861 from the insecticide resistant
		  laboratory strain. The contigs most differentially
		  represented in the resistant strain belong to the P450 gene
		  family and cuticular genes which correlates with previous

		  pyrethroid resistance. qPCR carried out on six contigs
		  indicates that these ESTs could be suitable for gene

		  and analysis of SNPs from 20 contigs suggested that most of
		  these SNPs are likely to be true SNPs. Gene conservation
		  analysis confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship
		  between An. funestus and An. gambiae.\\ This study
		  represents a significant advance for the genetics and
		  genomics of An. funestus since it provides an extensive set
		  of both Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and SNPs which can

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND:Within the last 25 years, after the
		  introduction of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides
		  crassus from East-Asia to Europe, a body of work has
		  aggregated on the host parasite interactions in the
		  acquired host Anguilla anguilla. Despite the emerging
		  evolutionary interest there is still a lack of knowledge
		  about host parasite relations of A. crassus in its natural
		  host Anguilla japonica. We examined the Anguillicoloides
		  infections of wild-caught Japanese eels as well as from
		  aquacultured specimens in Taiwan with respect to the fate
		  of migratory L3 larva and performed infection experiments
		  with Japanese eels.RESULTS:Inside the intestinal wall of
		  cultured eels, where the infective pressure was higher than
		  among wild eels, we found large numbers of granuloma-like
		  cysts. In a few eels these cysts contained nematodes still
		  recognizable as L3 larvae of A. crassus, while in most
		  cases the content of these capsules was degraded to
		  amorphous matter. Occurrence of these objects was
		  correlated with the number of encapsulated larvae in the
		  swimbladder wall. We were able to show, that the cysts
		  contained disintegrated L3 larvae by amplification and
		  subsequent sequencing of large subunit ribosomal rRNA.
		  Furthermore we identified repeated infections with high
		  doses of larvae as prerequisites for the processes of
		  encapsulation in infection experiments.CONCLUSIONS:Under
		  high infective pressure a large percentage of L3 larvae of
		  A. crassus coming from the gut lumen are eliminated by the
		  natural host within its intestinal tissue. It is possible
		  to reproduce this condition in infection experiments. We
		  provide a fast, easy and reliable PCR-based method for
		  identification of encapsulated swimbladder parasites.}

  abstract	= {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Roche 454 pyrosequencing has become
		  a method of choice for generating transcriptome data from
		  non-model organisms. Once the tens to hundreds of thousands
		  of short (250-450 base) reads have been produced, it is
		  important to correctly assemble these to estimate the
		  sequence of all the transcripts. Most transcriptome
		  assembly projects use only one program for assembling 454
		  pyrosequencing reads, but there is no evidence that the
		  programs used to date are optimal. We have carried out a
		  systematic comparison of five assemblers (CAP3, MIRA,
		  Newbler, SeqMan and CLC) to establish best practices for
		  transcriptome assemblies, using a new dataset from the
		  parasitic nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. RESULTS:
		  Although no single assembler performed best on all our
		  criteria, Newbler 2.5 gave longer contigs, better
		  alignments to some reference sequences, and was fast and
		  easy to use. SeqMan assemblies performed best on the
		  criterion of recapitulating known transcripts, and had more
		  novel sequence than the other assemblers, but generated an
		  excess of small, redundant contigs. The remaining
		  assemblers all performed almost as well, with the exception
		  of Newbler 2.3 (the version currently used by most assembly
		  projects), which generated assemblies that had
		  significantly lower total length. As different assemblers
		  use different underlying algorithms to generate contigs, we
		  also explored merging of assemblies and found that the
		  merged datasets not only aligned better to reference
		  sequences than individual assemblies, but were also more
		  consistent in the number and size of contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Transcriptome assemblies are smaller than genome assemblies
		  and thus should be more computationally tractable, but are
		  often harder because individual contigs can have highly
		  variable read coverage. Comparing single assemblers,
		  Newbler 2.5 performed best on our trial data set, but other
		  assemblers were closely comparable. Combining differently
		  optimal assemblies from different programs however gave a
		  more credible final product, and this strategy is
		  recommended.},

  abstract	= {Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts)
		  and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which
		  they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status
		  of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low
		  extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency,
		  invasions have been followed by the dispersal and
		  establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or
		  parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both
		  hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed
		  together, although both are usually interwoven in various
		  ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and
		  colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put
		  forward depending on the scientific background of
		  respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain
		  invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse
		  characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of
		  dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in
		  populations of alien species have come to different
		  conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of
		  parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on
		  economically important hosts, have long been at the centre
		  of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as
		  well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing
		  many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the
		  liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the
		  swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of eels are
		  shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of
		  animal invasions and environmental global change.
		  Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with
		  imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various
		  target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as
		  intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or
		  were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite
		  {(Europe)} and/or from other regions which were not within
		  the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting
		  progressive stages of a global biota change. In several
		  introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or
		  exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with
		  thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended
		  range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native
		  or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts.
		  Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica,
		  however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an
		  evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East,
		  has invaded three continents, without the previous
		  naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by
		  switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local
		  entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate
		  hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in
		  respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching
		  consequences for the parasite's morphology (size),
		  abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection
		  experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many
		  differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring
		  coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with
		  the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of
		  native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated
		  pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other
		  deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of
		  the na\"{i}ve host compared to the donor host which
		  displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the
		  abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of
		  available literature, it can be concluded that the
		  adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the
		  alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more.
		  Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as
		  aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured
		  out, but individual case studies teach us that
		  generalizations should be avoided.},

		  scanning electron microscopy. During the course of probably
		  several infections swimbladders undergo characteristic
		  changes. In addition to the thickening of the entire
		  swimbladder wall, and to the folded internal surface of
		  this organ, inflammation, migration of white blood cells,
		  fibrosis and changes in the epithelial cells are frequently
		  seen. Epithelial cells tend to proliferate heavily and form
		  hyperplastic tissues; these processes are accompanied by
		  changes in the internal structure of the cells. The
		  normally cubic cells become spherical or columnar and form
		  folds facing the lumen of the swimbladder. As a
		  consequence, most of these cells lose contact with the
		  blood vessels and show no strict polarity. In heavily
		  affected swimbladders the basal labyrinth of the epithelial
		  cells is reduced, i.e. becomes shorter and less densely
		  packed. The lamina propria shows severe fibrosis with
		  infiltration of white blood cells. Larvae of A. crassus,
		  inhabiting the wall of the swimbladder, were found to be
		  surrounded by cell debris, but this local necrosis does not
		  affect the entire swimbladder in its overall structure.
		  These histological findings can partly explain changes in
		  the gas composition in eels infected with A. crassus.},

		  thiolase, all of which use acetoacetyl-CoA as substrate but
		  which have different intracellular locations and substrate
		  specificities and which differ also in kinetic and

		  was found to be widely distributed among different tissues
		  and was due to an acetoacetyl-CoA-specific thiolase. This
		  cytoplasmic activity was found to account for a significant
		  proportion of the total tissue activity towards
		  acetoacetyl-CoA in several tissues, and especially in the
		  brain of newborn rats. 4. Mitochondrial thiolase activity
		  towards acetoacetyl-CoA was due to two different classes of
		  enzyme whose relative amounts varied with the tissue type.
		  An oxoacyl-CoA thiolase of general specificity for the
		  acyl-CoA substrate constituted one class, the other being a

		  sexual reproduction usually involves an extensive,

		  Under certain combinations of costs and benefits to

		  through increased reproduction of her offspring, from the
		  very genes that produce sexually antagonistic traits in the
		  male. In short, females can sometimes gain by "losing."
		  Such Fisherian payoffs are also possible, though probably
		  less important, for males. Gaining by losing is not
		  feasible in most other contexts of evolutionary conflict,
		  except under some conditions in parent-offspring conflict.
		  Some apparent parent-offspring conflicts may instead be
		  parental choice among offspring that is analogous to

		  pyrethroid resistant laboratory strain and a pyrethroid
		  susceptible field strain from Mali.\\ USING A POOL OF LIFE
		  STAGES (PUPAE, LARVAE, ADULTS: females and males) for each
		  strain, 454 sequencing generated 375,619 reads (average
		  length of 182 bp). De novo assembly generated 18,103
		  contigs with average length of 253 bp. The average depth of
		  coverage of these contigs was 8.3. In total 20.8% of all
		  reads were novel when compared to reference databases. The
		  sequencing of the field strain generated 204,758 reads
		  compared to 170,861 from the insecticide resistant
		  laboratory strain. The contigs most differentially
		  represented in the resistant strain belong to the P450 gene
		  family and cuticular genes which correlates with previous
		  studies implicating both of these gene families in
		  pyrethroid resistance. qPCR carried out on six contigs
		  indicates that these ESTs could be suitable for gene
		  expression studies such as microarray. 31,000 sites were
		  estimated to contain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
		  and analysis of SNPs from 20 contigs suggested that most of
		  these SNPs are likely to be true SNPs. Gene conservation
		  analysis confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship
		  between An. funestus and An. gambiae.\\ This study
		  represents a significant advance for the genetics and
		  genomics of An. funestus since it provides an extensive set
		  of both Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and SNPs which can
		  be readily adopted for the design of new genomic tools such

		  {ESTs} from a {cDNA} library constructed by oligo-capping
		  to select full-length {cDNAs,} as well as from conventional
		  {cDNA} libraries. {SignalP} analysis was applied to

		  introduction of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides
		  crassus from East-Asia to Europe, a body of work has
		  aggregated on the host parasite interactions in the
		  acquired host Anguilla anguilla. Despite the emerging
		  evolutionary interest there is still a lack of knowledge
		  about host parasite relations of A. crassus in its natural
		  host Anguilla japonica. We examined the Anguillicoloides
		  infections of wild-caught Japanese eels as well as from
		  aquacultured specimens in Taiwan with respect to the fate
		  of migratory L3 larva and performed infection experiments
		  with Japanese eels.RESULTS:Inside the intestinal wall of
		  cultured eels, where the infective pressure was higher than
		  among wild eels, we found large numbers of granuloma-like
		  cysts. In a few eels these cysts contained nematodes still
		  recognizable as L3 larvae of A. crassus, while in most
		  cases the content of these capsules was degraded to
		  amorphous matter. Occurrence of these objects was
		  correlated with the number of encapsulated larvae in the
		  swimbladder wall. We were able to show, that the cysts
		  contained disintegrated L3 larvae by amplification and
		  subsequent sequencing of large subunit ribosomal rRNA.
		  Furthermore we identified repeated infections with high
		  doses of larvae as prerequisites for the processes of
		  encapsulation in infection experiments.CONCLUSIONS:Under
		  high infective pressure a large percentage of L3 larvae of
		  A. crassus coming from the gut lumen are eliminated by the
		  natural host within its intestinal tissue. It is possible
		  to reproduce this condition in infection experiments. We
		  provide a fast, easy and reliable PCR-based method for
		  identification of encapsulated swimbladder parasites.}

  abstract	= {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Roche 454 pyrosequencing has become
		  a method of choice for generating transcriptome data from
		  non-model organisms. Once the tens to hundreds of thousands
		  of short (250-450 base) reads have been produced, it is
		  important to correctly assemble these to estimate the
		  sequence of all the transcripts. Most transcriptome
		  assembly projects use only one program for assembling 454
		  pyrosequencing reads, but there is no evidence that the
		  programs used to date are optimal. We have carried out a
		  systematic comparison of five assemblers (CAP3, MIRA,
		  Newbler, SeqMan and CLC) to establish best practices for
		  transcriptome assemblies, using a new dataset from the
		  parasitic nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. RESULTS:
		  Although no single assembler performed best on all our
		  criteria, Newbler 2.5 gave longer contigs, better
		  alignments to some reference sequences, and was fast and
		  easy to use. SeqMan assemblies performed best on the
		  criterion of recapitulating known transcripts, and had more
		  novel sequence than the other assemblers, but generated an
		  excess of small, redundant contigs. The remaining
		  assemblers all performed almost as well, with the exception
		  of Newbler 2.3 (the version currently used by most assembly
		  projects), which generated assemblies that had
		  significantly lower total length. As different assemblers
		  use different underlying algorithms to generate contigs, we
		  also explored merging of assemblies and found that the
		  merged datasets not only aligned better to reference
		  sequences than individual assemblies, but were also more
		  consistent in the number and size of contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Transcriptome assemblies are smaller than genome assemblies
		  and thus should be more computationally tractable, but are
		  often harder because individual contigs can have highly
		  variable read coverage. Comparing single assemblers,
		  Newbler 2.5 performed best on our trial data set, but other
		  assemblers were closely comparable. Combining differently
		  optimal assemblies from different programs however gave a
		  more credible final product, and this strategy is
		  recommended.},

  abstract	= {Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts)
		  and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which
		  they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status
		  of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low
		  extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency,
		  invasions have been followed by the dispersal and
		  establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or
		  parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both
		  hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed
		  together, although both are usually interwoven in various
		  ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and
		  colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put
		  forward depending on the scientific background of
		  respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain
		  invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse
		  characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of
		  dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in
		  populations of alien species have come to different
		  conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of
		  parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on
		  economically important hosts, have long been at the centre
		  of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as
		  well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing
		  many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the
		  liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the
		  swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of eels are
		  shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of
		  animal invasions and environmental global change.
		  Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with
		  imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various
		  target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as
		  intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or
		  were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite
		  {(Europe)} and/or from other regions which were not within
		  the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting
		  progressive stages of a global biota change. In several
		  introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or
		  exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with
		  thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended
		  range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native
		  or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts.
		  Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica,
		  however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an
		  evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East,
		  has invaded three continents, without the previous
		  naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by
		  switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local
		  entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate
		  hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in
		  respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching
		  consequences for the parasite's morphology (size),
		  abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection
		  experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many
		  differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring
		  coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with
		  the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of
		  native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated
		  pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other
		  deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of
		  the na\"{i}ve host compared to the donor host which
		  displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the
		  abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of
		  available literature, it can be concluded that the
		  adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the
		  alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more.
		  Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as
		  aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured
		  out, but individual case studies teach us that
		  generalizations should be avoided.},

		  and Gnathostomatidae constitute the basal branch of the
		  suborder Spirurina. The genera Philometra and
		  Philometroides appear to be paraphyletic, while on the
		  higher taxonomic level, good correlation between the
		  morphology-based system and molecular data was observed.

  abstract	= {The histopathological changes in swimbladders of European
		  eels naturally and experimentally infected with
		  Anguillicola crassus were studied using transmission and
		  scanning electron microscopy. During the course of probably
		  several infections swimbladders undergo characteristic
		  changes. In addition to the thickening of the entire
		  swimbladder wall, and to the folded internal surface of
		  this organ, inflammation, migration of white blood cells,
		  fibrosis and changes in the epithelial cells are frequently
		  seen. Epithelial cells tend to proliferate heavily and form
		  hyperplastic tissues; these processes are accompanied by
		  changes in the internal structure of the cells. The
		  normally cubic cells become spherical or columnar and form
		  folds facing the lumen of the swimbladder. As a
		  consequence, most of these cells lose contact with the
		  blood vessels and show no strict polarity. In heavily
		  affected swimbladders the basal labyrinth of the epithelial
		  cells is reduced, i.e. becomes shorter and less densely
		  packed. The lamina propria shows severe fibrosis with
		  infiltration of white blood cells. Larvae of A. crassus,
		  inhabiting the wall of the swimbladder, were found to be
		  surrounded by cell debris, but this local necrosis does not
		  affect the entire swimbladder in its overall structure.
		  These histological findings can partly explain changes in
		  the gas composition in eels infected with A. crassus.},
