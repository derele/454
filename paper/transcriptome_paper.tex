\begin{abstract}
  % Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
  \paragraph*{Background:} \textit{Anguillicola crassus} is an
  economically and ecologically important parasitic nematode of
  eels. The native range of \textit{A. crassus} is in Asia, where it
  infects \textit{Anguilla japonica}, the japanese
  eel. \textit{A. crassus} was introduced into European eels,
  \textit{Anguilla angulla}, 30 years ago. The parasite is more
  pathogenic in its new host than in its native one, and is thought to
  threaten the endangered \textit{An. anguilla} across its range. The
  molecular bases for the increased pathogenicity of the nematodes in
  their new hosts is not known.
  \paragraph*{Results:} A reference transcriptome was assembled for
  \textit{A. crassus} from Roche 454 pyrosequencing data. Raw reads
  (756,363 total) from nematodes from \textit{An. japonica} and
  \textit{An. anguilla} hosts were filtered for likely host
  contaminats and ribosomal RNAs. The remaining 353,055 reads were
  assembled into 11,372 high confidence (HC) contigs (spanning 6.6 Mb)
  and 21,153 singletons and lower confidence contigs (spanning an
  additional 6.2 Mb). Roughly 55\% of the HC contigs could be
  annotated with domain- or protein sequence similarity match-derived
  functional information. Sequences conserved only in nematodes, or
  unique to \textit{A. crassus} were more likely to have secretory
  signal peptides. Thousands of high quality single nucleotide
  polymorphisms were identified, and coding polymorphism was
  correlated with differential expression between individual
  nematodes. Transcripts identified as being under positive selection
  were enriched in peptidases. Enzymes involved in energy metabolism
  were enriched in the set of genes differentially expressed between
  European and Asian \textit{A. crassus}.
  \paragraph*{Conclusions:}
  The reference transcriptome of \textit{A. crassus} is of high
  quality, and will serve as a basis for future work on the invasion
  biology of this important parasite. The polymorphisms identified
  will provide a key tool set for analysis of population structure and
  identification of genes likely to be involved in increased
  pathogenicity in European eel hosts. The identification of
  peptidases under positive selection is a first step in this
  programme.

\section*{Background}
 

The nematode \textit{Anguillicola crassus} Kuwahara, Niimi et Itagaki,
1974 is a native parasite of the Japanese eel \textit{Anguilla
  japonica} \cite{kuwahara_Niimi_Itagaki_1974}. Adults localise to the
swim bladder where they feed on blood
\cite{polzer_identification_1993}. Larvae are transmitted via
crustacean intermediate hosts
\cite{de_charleroy_life_1990}. Originally endemic to East- Asian
populations of \textit{An. japonica}, \textit{A. crassus} has
attracted interest due to recent anthropogenic expansion of its
geographic and host ranges to Europe and the European eel,
\textit{Anguilla anguilla}. \textit{A. crassus} was recorded for the
first time in Europe in North-West Germany in 1982
\cite{fischer_teichwirt}, where it was most likely introduced through
the live-eel trade \cite{koops_anguillicola-infestations_1989,
  koie_swimbladder_1991}, \textit{A. crassus} has subsequently spread
rapidly through populations of its newly acquired host
\cite{kirk_impact_2003}, and currently is found in all
\textit{An. anguilla} populations except those in Iceland
\cite{kristmundsson_parasite_2007}. \textit{A. crassus} can thus be
regarded as a model for the introduction and spread of invasive
parasite \cite{taraschewski_hosts_2007}.

In \textit{An. anguilla}, prevalence and mean intensity of infection
by \textit{A. crassus} are higher than in \textit{ An. japonica}
\cite{mnderle_occurrence_2006, lefebvre_anguillicolosis:_2004}. In
\textit{An.  anguilla} infections, the adult nematodes are larger, and
have an earlier onset of reproduction and a greater egg output
\cite{knopf_differences_2004}. \textit{An. anguilla} shows increased
pathology, including thickening and inflammation of the swim bladder
wall \cite{wurtz_tara_2000}. It has been suggested that the life
history modifications and changed virulence observed in
\textit{A. crassus} in the new host are due to an inadequate immune
response in \textit{An. anguilla}
\cite{knopf_swimbladder_2006}. \textit{An. japonica} is capable of
killing histotropic larvae of the parasite after vaccination
\cite{knopf_vaccination_2008} or under high infection pressure
\cite{heitlinger_massive_2009}, but this does not happen in
\textit{A. anguilla}.

The genus Anguillicola is placed in the nematode suborder Spirurina
(clade III \textit{sensu} \cite{blaxter_molecular_1998})
\cite{nadler_molecular_2007, wijov_evolutionary_2006}. The Spirurina
are exclusively parasitic and include important human pathogens (the
causative agents of filariasis and ascariasis) as well as prominent
veterinary parasites. Molecular phylogenetic analyses place
Anguillicola in a clade of spirurine nematodes (Spirurina B of
\cite{dl_py}) that have a freshwater or marine intermediate host, but
infect a wide range of carnivorous definitive hosts. Spirurina B is
sister to the main Spirurina C, including the agents of filariasis and
ascariasis), and thus \textit{A. crassus} may be used as an outgroup
taxon to understand the evolution of parasitic phenotypes in these
species.

The differences in the biology of \textit{A. crassus} in
\textit{An. japonica} (coevolved) and \textit{An. anguilla} (recently
captured) eel hosts likely results from differential interactions
between host genetics and parasite genetics. While genetic differences
between the host species are expected, it is not known what part, if
any, genetic differentiation between the invading European and endemic
Asian parasites plays.  European \textit{A. crassus} are less
genetically variable than parasites taken from Asian hosts
\cite{wielgoss_population_2008}, reflecting the derived nature of the
invading populations and the likely population bottlenecks this
entailed. As part of a programme to understand the invasiveness of
\textit{A. crassus} in \textit{An. anguilla}, we are investigating
differences in gene expression and genetic distinction between
invading European and endemic Asian \textit{A. crassus} exposed to the
two host species.

Recent advances in sequencing technology (often termed Next Generation
Sequencing; NGS), provide the opportunity for rapid and cost-effective
generation of genome-scale data. The Roche 454 platform
\cite{pmid16056220} is particularly suited to transcriptomics of
previously unstudied species \cite{pmid20950480}.

Here we report on the generation of a reference transcriptome for
\textit{A. crassus} based on Roche 454 data, and explore patterns of
gene expression and diversity within the nematode.

\section*{Methods}


\subsection*{Nematode samples, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Sequencing}

\textit{A. crassus} from \textit{An. japonica} were sampled from
Kao-Ping river and an adjacent aquaculture in Taiwan as described in
\cite{heitlinger_massive_2009}. Nematodes from \textit{An. anguilla}
were sampled from Sniardwy Lake, Poland (53.751959N, 21.730957E) and
from the Linkenheimer Altrhein, Germany (49.0262N, 8.310556E). After
determination of the sex of adult nematodes, they were stored in
RNA-later (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) until extraction of RNA. RNA was
extracted from individual adult male and female nematodes and from a
population of L2 larvae (Table 1). RNA was reverse transcribed and
amplified into cDNA using the MINT-cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia). For host contamination screening a liver sample from
an uninfected \textit{An. japonica} was also processed. Emulsion PCR
was performed for each cDNA library according to the manufacturer's
protocols (Roche/454 Life Sciences), and sequenced on a Roche 454
Genome Sequencer FLX.

Raw sequencing reads are archived under study-accession number
SRP010313 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra) \cite{pmid22140104}. All
samples were sequenced using the FLX Titanium chemistry, except for
the Taiwanese female sample T1, which was sequenced using FLX standard
chemistry, to generate between 99,000 and 209,000 raw reads. For the
L2 larval library, which had a larger number of
non-\textit{A. crassus}, non-\textit{Anguilla} reads, we confirmed
that these data were not laboratory contaminants by screening Roche
454 data produced on the same run in independent sequencing lanes.

\subsection*{Trimming, quality control and assembly}

Raw sequences were extracted in FASTA format (with the corresponding
qualities files) using sffinfo (Roche/454) and screened for MINT
adapter sequences using cross-match \cite{PHRAP} (with parameters
-minscore 20 -minmatch 10). Seqclean \cite{tgicl_pertea} was used to
identify and remove poly-A-tails, low quality, repetitive and short
(<100 base) sequences. All reads were compared to a set of screening
databases using BLAST (expect value cutoff E<1e-5, low complexity
filtering turned off: -F F). The databases used were (a) a host
sequence database comprising an assembly of the \textit{An. japonica}
Roche 454 data, a unpublished assembly of \textit{An. anguilla} Sanger
dideoxy sequenced expressed sequence tags (made available to us by
Gordon Cramb, University of St Andrews) and transcripts from EeelBase
\cite{pmid21080939}, a publicly available transcriptome database for
the European eel; (b) a database of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences
from eel species derived from our Roche 454 data and EMBL-Bank; and
(c) a database of rRNA sequences identified in our \textit{A. crassus}
data by comparing the reads to known nematode rRNAs from
EMBL-Bank. This last database notably also contained xenobiont rRNA
sequences. Reads with matches to one of these databases over more than
80\% of their length and with greater than 95\% identity were removed
from the dataset. Screening and trimming information was written back
into sff-format using sfffile (Roche 454). The filtered and trimmed
data were assembled using the combined assembly approach
\cite{pmid20950480}: two assemblies were generated, one using Newbler
v2.6 \cite{pmid16056220} (with parameters -cdna -urt), the other using
Mira v3.2.1 \cite{miraEST} (with parameters
--job=denovo,est,accurate,454). The resulting two assemblies were
combined into one using Cap3 \cite{Cap3_Huang} at default settings and
contigs were labeled by whether they derived from both assemblies
(high confidence assembly; highCA), or one assembly only (lowCA; for a
detailed analysis of the assembly categories see the supporting
Methods file). The superset of highCA and lowCA contigs and the
remaining unassembled reads defines the set of tentatively unique
genes (TUGs).

\subsection*{Post-assembly classification and taxonomic assignment of
  contigs}

We rescreened the assembled assembly for host and other contamination
by comparing them (using BLAST) to the three databases defined above,
and also to NEMBASE4, a nematode transcriptome database derived from
whole genome sequencing and EST assemblies
\cite{parkinson_nembase:resource_2004, pmid21550347}. For each contig,
the highest-scoring match was recorded as long as it spanned more than
50\% of the contig. We also compared the contigs to the NCBI
non-redundant nucleotide (NCBI-nt) and protein (NCBI-nr) databases,
recording the taxonomy of all best matches with expect values better
than 1e-05. Sequences with a best hit to non-Metazoans or to Chordata
within Metazoa were excluded from further analysis.

%% nrow(contig.df[!contig.df$Ac &
%% contig.df$contamination%in%"eelmRNA" & contig.df$phylum.nr%in%"Nematoda", ])
%% investigate if these (149) should not be included rather as
%% Ac-origin DONE!!! The eelmRNA hits are _all_ much better!

\subsection*{Protein prediction and annotation}

Protein translations were predicted from the contigs using prot4EST
(version 3.0b) \cite{wasmuth_prot4est:_2004}. Proteins were predicted
either by joining single high scoring segment pairs (HSPs) from a
BLAST search of uniref100 \cite{pmid18836194}, or by ESTscan
\cite{estscan}, using as training data the \textit{Brugia malayi}
complete proteome back-translated using a codon usage table derived
from the BLAST HSPs, or, if the first two methods failed, simply the
longest ORF in the contig. For contigs where the protein prediction
required insertion or deletion of bases in the original sequence, we
also imputed an edited sequence for each affected contig. Annotations
with Gene Ontology (GO), Enzyme Commission (EC) and Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms were inferred for these proteins
using annot8r (version 1.1.1) \cite{schmid_annot8r:_2008}, using the
annotated sequences available in uniref100 \cite{pmid18836194}. Up to
10 annotations based on a BLAST similarity bitscore cut-off of 55 were
obtained for each annotation set. The complete \textit{B. malayi}
proteome (as present in uniref100) and the complete
\textit{C. elegans} proteome (as present in WormBase v.220) were also
annotated in the same way. SignalP V4.0 \cite{pmid21959131} was used
to predict signal peptide cleavage sites and signal anchor signatures
for the \textit{A. crassus}-transcriptome and for the proteomes of the
two model-nematodes. InterProScan \cite{pmid11590104} (command line
utility iprscan version 4.6 with options -cli -format raw -iprlookup
-seqtype p -goterms) was used to obtain domain annotations for the
high credibility assembly (highCA) derived contigs.

We recorded the presence of a lethal RNAi-phenotype in the
\textit{C. elegans} ortholog of each TUG using the biomart -interface
\cite{pmid22083790} to WormBase v. 220 through the R-package biomaRt
\cite{pmid19617889}.

\subsection*{Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis}

We mapped the raw reads to the the complete set of contigs, replacing
imputed sequences for originals where relevant, using ssaha2 (with
parameters -kmer 13 -skip 3 -seeds 6 -score 100 -cmatch 10 -ckmer 6
-output sam -best 1) \cite{pmid11591649}. From the ssaha2 output,
pileup -files were produced using samtools
\cite{journals/bioinformatics/LiHWFRHMAD09}, discarding reads mapping
to multiple regions. VarScan \cite{pmid19542151} (pileup2snp) was used
with default parameters on pileup -files to output lists of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their locations.


In the 10,496 SNPs thus defined, the ratio of transitions (ti; 6,908)
to transversion (tv; 3,588) was 1.93. From the prot4EST predictions,
7,189 of the SNPs were predicted to be inside an ORF, with 2,322 at
codon first positions, 1,832 at second positions and 3,035 at third
positions. As expected, ti/tv inside ORFs (2.39) was higher than
outside ORFs (1.25). The ratio of synonymous polymorphisms per
synonymous site to non-synonymous polymorphisms per non-synonymous
site in this unfiltered SNP set (dn/ds) was 0.45, rather high compared
to other analyses. Roche 454 sequences have well-known systematic
errors associated with homopolymeric nucleotide sequences [58], and
the effect of exclusion of SNPs in, or close to, homopolymer regions
was explored. When SNPs were discarded using different size thresholds
for homopolymer runs and proximity thresholds, the ti/tv and in dn/ds
ratios changed (Additional Figure 1). Based on this SNPs associated with a
homopolymer-run as long as or longer than 4 bases inside a window of
11 bases (5 to bases to the right, 5 to the left) around the SNP were
discarded. There was a relationship between TUG dn/ds and TUG
coverage, associated with the presence of sites with low abundance
minority alleles (less than 7\% of the allele calls), suggesting that
some of these may be errors. Removing low abundance minority allele
SNPs from the set removed this effect (Additional Figure 2).

For enrichment analysis of GO-terms we used the R-package GOstats
\cite{pmid17098774}.

Using Samtools \cite{journals/bioinformatics/LiHWFRHMAD09} (mpileup
-u) and Vcftools \cite{pmid21653522} (view -gcv) we genotyped
individual libraries for each of the master list of SNPs. Genotype-
calls were accepted at a phred- scaled genotype quality threshold of
10. In addition to the relative heterozygosity (number of homozygous
sites/number of heterozygous sites) we used the R package Rhh
\cite{pmid21565077} to calculate internal relatedness
\cite{pmid11571049}, homozygosity by locus \cite{pmid17107491} and
standardised heterozygosity \cite{coltman81j} from these data.

We confirmed the significance of heterozygote-heterozygote correlation
by analysing the mean and 95\% confidence intervals from 1000
bootstrap replicates estimated for all measurements.

\subsection*{Gene-expression analysis}

Read- counts were obtained from the bam-files generated for genotyping
using the R- package Rsamtoools \cite{rsamtools}. 

LowCA contigs and contigs with less than 32 reads over all libraries
were excluded from analysis. Libraries E1 and L2 had very low overall
counts and thus we excluded these libraries from analysis. The
statistic of Audic and Claverie \cite{pmid9331369} as implemented in
ideg6 \cite{pmid12429865} was used to contrast single
libraries. Differential expression between libraries from male versus
female nematodes was accepted for genes that differed in expression
values between all the female libraries (E2, T1 and T2; see Table 1)
versus the male (M) library (p <0.01), but had no differential
expression within any of the female libraries at the same
threshold. Differential expression between libraries from nematodes of
European \textit{An. anguilla} and Taiwanese \textit{An. japonica}
origin was accepted for genes that differed in expression values
between library E2 and both libraries T1 and T2 (p <0.01), but showed
no differences between T1 and T2.

\subsection*{Over-representation analyses}

The R-package annotationDbi \cite{AnnotationDbi} was used to obtain a
full list of associations (along with higher-level terms) from annot8r
annotations prior to analysis of GO term over-representation in gene
sets selected on the basis of dn/ds or expression values. The
R-package topGO \cite{topGO} was used to traverse the annotation graph
and analyse each node term for over-representation in the focal gene
set compared to an appropriate universal gene set (all contigs with
dn/ds values or all contigs analysed for gene expression) with the
``classic'' method and Fisher's exact test. Terms for which an
offspring term was already in the table and no additional counts
supported overrepresentation were removed. Mann-Whitney u-tests were
used to test the inuence of factors on dn/ds values. To investigate
multiple contrasts between groups (factors) Nemenyi-Damico-Wolfe-Dunn
tests were used, and for overrepresentation of one group (factor) in
other groups (factors) Fisher's exact test was used.

\subsection*{General coding methods}

The bulk of analysis (unless otherwise described) presented was
carried out in R \cite{R_project} using custom scripts. For
visualisation we used the R-packages ggplot2 \cite{ggplot-book} and
VennDiagram \cite{pmid21269502}. We used a method provided in the
R-packages Sweave \cite{lmucs-papers:Leisch:2002} and Weaver
\cite{weaver} for ``reproducible research'' combining R and \LaTeX
code in a single file. All intermediate data files needed to compile

\section*{Results}


\subsection*{Sampling \textit{A. crassus}}


One female \textit{A. crassus} and one male \textit{A. crassus} were
sampled from an \textit{An. japonica} aquaculture with high infection
loads in Taiwan, and an additional female was sampled from an
\textit{An. japonica} caught in a stream with low infection pressure
adjacent to the aquaculture. A female nematode and pool of L2 larval
stages were sampled from \textit{An. anguilla} in the river Rhine, and
one female from \textit{A. anguilla} from a lake in Poland. All adult
nematodes were replete with host blood. To assist in downstream
filtering of host from nematode reads, we also sampled RNA from the
liver of an uninfected taiwanese \textit{An. japonica}.

 \subsection*{Sequencing, trimming and pre-assembly screening}







A total of 756,363 raw sequencing reads
were generated for \textit{A. crassus} (Table 1). These were trimmed
for base call quality, and filtered by length to give
585,949 high-quality reads (spanning
169,863,104 bases). From An. japonica liver RNA
159,370 raw reads were generated, and
135,072 retained after basic quality
screening. These eel reads were assembled into
10,639 contigs.

The \textit{A. crassus} reads were screened for contamination by host
sequence by comparison to our assembled \textit{An. japonica} 454
transcriptome and publicly accessible \textit{An. anguilla} sequence
data, and 30,071 reads removed. By
comparison to \textit{A. crassus} small subunit ribosomal RNA
(sequenced previously) and large subunit ribosomal RNA (assembled from
our reads in preliminary analyses),
181,783 were tagged and removed. The
L2 larval library proved to have contributions for other cobionts of
the eel, and 5,286 reads were
removed because they matched closely to cercozoan (likely parasite)
ribosomal RNA genes.

\subsection*{Assembly and post-assembly screening}


The remaining 353,055 reads (spanning
100,491,819 bases) were assembled using the combined assembler
strategy \cite{pmid20950480}, employing Roche 454 GSassembler (version
2.6) and MIRA (version 3.21) \cite{miraEST}. In this coassembly,
13,851 contigs were supported by both assembly algorithms,
3,745 contigs were supported by only one of the assembly
algorithms and 22,591 singletons were not assembled by
either program (Table 2). Contigs supported by both assemblers were
longer, and were more likely to have a significant similarity to
previously sequenced protein coding genes than contigs assembled by
only one of the algorithms, or the remaining unassembled
singletons. These constitute the high credibility assembly (highCA),
while those with evidence from only one assembler and the singletons
are the low credibility assembly (lowCA). These datasets were the most
parsimonious (having the smallest size) for their quality (covering
the largest amount of sequence in reference transcriptomes). In the
highCA parsimony and low redundancy was prioritized, while in the
complete assembly (highCA plus lowCA) completeness was
prioritized. The 40,187 sequences (contig consensuses and singletons)
in the complete assembly are referred to as tentatively unique genes
(TUGs).




We screened the complete assembly for remaining host contamination,
and identified 3,441 TUGs that had significant, higher
similarity to eel (and chordate; EMBLBank Chordata proteins) than to
nematode sequences \cite{pmid21550347}. Given the identification of
cercozoan ribosomal RNAs in the L2 library, we also screened the
complete assembly for contamination with other transcriptomes. 

1,153 TUGs were found with highest significant similarity to Eukaryota
outside of the kingdoms Metazoa, Fungi and Viridiplantae. These
contigs matched genes from a wide range of protists from Apicomplexa
(mainly Sarcocystidae, 28 hits and Cryptosporidiidae 10 hits),
Bacillariophyta (diatoms, mainly Phaeodactylaceae, 41 hits),
Phaeophyceae (brown algae, mainly Ectocarpaceae, 180 hits),
Stramenopiles (Albuginaceae, 63 hits), Kinetoplasitda
(Trypanosomatidae, 26 hits) and Heterolobosea (Vahlkampfidae, 38
hits). Additionally 298 TUGs had best,
significant matches to genes from fungi (e.g Ajellomycetaceae, 53
hits) and 585 TUGs had best, significant matches to genes from
plants. Outside the Eukaryota there were significant best matches to
Bacteria (825 TUGs; mostly to members of the Proteobacteria), Archaea
(8 TUGs) and viruses (9 TUGs). No TUGs had significant, best matches
to Wolbachia or related Bacteria known as symbionts of nematodes and
arthropods. All TUGs with highest similarity to sequences deriving
from taxa outside Metazoa were excluded. The final, screened
\textit{A. crassus} assembly has
32,525 TUGs, spanning
12,733,095
bases (of which 11,372 are
highCA-derived, and span
6,575,121
bases). All analyses reported below are based on this filtered
dataset.

\subsection*{Annotation}


We predicted proteins for

TUGs using prot4EST  (Table 2) and
obtained the full open reading frame in
 TUGs,
while while for
the 5’ end
and for  the
3' end was complete. In  TUGs the
based on protein prediction corrected sequence with the imputed ORF
was slightly changed compared to the raw sequence.




For
32,418
screened TUGs a protein was predicted using prot4EST
\cite{wasmuth_prot4est:_2004} (Table 2). An apparently full-length
open reading frame (ORF) was obtained in
353 TUGs,
while for 2,683
the 5' ends and for
8,283 the 3' ends
were complete. In 13,383 TUGs the corrected
sequence with the imputed ORF was slightly changed compared to the raw
sequence. One third of the TUGs had significant similarity to proteins
from other nematodes:

9,556
TUGs matched \textit{C. elegans} proteins,
9,664
TUGs matched \textit{B. malayi}, and
11,620
TUGs had matches in NEMPEP4 \cite{parkinson_nembase:resource_2004,
  pmid21550347}. Comparison to the UniProt reference identified
11,115
TUGs with significant similarities. We used annot8r
\cite{schmid_annot8r:_2008} to assign GO terms to 6,511
TUGs, EC numbers for 2,460 TUGs and KEGG pathway annotations
for 3,846 TUGs (Table 2). Additionally 5,125
highCA derived contigs were annotated with GO terms through
InterProScan \cite{pmid11590104}. 

Nearly one third (6,989) of the
\textit{A. crassus} TUGs were annotated with at least one identifier,
and 1,831 had GO, EC and KEGG annotations (Figure
1).

We compared our \textit{A. crassus} GO annotations for high-level
GO-slim terms to the annotations (obtained the same way) for the
complete proteome of the Spirurid filarial nematode \textit{B. malayi}
and the complete proteome of \textit{C. elegans} (Figure 2). The
occurrence of GO terms in the annotation of the partial transcriptome
of \textit{A. crassus} was more similar to that for the proteome of
\textit{B. malayi} (0.95; Spearman correlation coefficient) than to
the that of the proteome of \textit{C. elegans} (0.9).

We compared our \textit{A. crassus} GO annotations for high-level
GO-slim terms to the annotations (obtained the same way) for the
complete proteome of the filarial nematode \textit{B. malayi} and the
complete proteome of \textit{C. elegans} (Figure 2).

Despite the lack of completeness at the 5' end suggested by peptide
prediction, just over 3\% of the TUGs were predicted to be secreted
(920 with signal peptide cleavage sites and
65 signal peptides with a transmembrane
signature). Again these predictions are more similar to predictions
using the same methods for the proteome of \textit{B. malayi} (742
signal peptide cleavage sites and 41 with transmembrane anchor) than
for the proteome of \textit{C. elegans} (4,273 signal peptide cleavage
sites and 154 with transmembrane anchor).

By comparison to RNAi phenotypes for \textit{C. elegans} genes
\cite{pmid12529635, pmid19910365} likely to be orthologous to
\textit{A. crassus} TUGs, 6,029 TUGs were inferred to be essential
(RNAi lethal phenotype in \textit{C. elegans}).

To explore the phylogenetic conservation of \textit{A. crassus} TUGs,
they were classified as conserved across kingdoms, conserved in
Metazoa, conserved in Nematoda, conserved in Spirurina or novel to
\textit{A. crassus} by comparing them to custom database subsets using
BLAST (Table 3). Using a relatively strict cutoff, a quarter of the
highCA derived contigs were conserved across kingdoms, and ~10\% were
apparently restricted to Nematoda. Nearly half of the highCA contigs
were novel to \textit{A. crassus}.

Similar patterns were observed for conservation assessed at different
stringency, and when assessed across all TUGs, except that a higher
proportion of all TUGs were apparently unique to \textit{A. crassus}.

Proteins predicted to be resticted to Nematoda and novel in
\textit{A. crassus} were significantly enriched in signal peptide
annotation compared to conserved proteins, proteins novel in Metazoa
and novel in clade III (Fisher's exact test p<0.001 ; Figure 3).

The proportion of lethal RNAi phenotypes was significantly higher for
\textit{C. elegans} presumed orthologs of TUGs conserved across
kingdoms (97.23\%) than for orthologs of TUGs not conserved across
kingdoms (94.59\%; p<0.001, Fisher's exact test).

\subsection*{Identification and analysis of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms}

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using VARScan
\cite{pmid19542151} on the 1,100,522 bases of TUGs that
had coverage of more then 8-fold available. SNPs predicted to have
more than 2 alleles, or that mapped to an undetermined (N) base were
excluded, as were SNP likely to be due to base calling errors close to
homopolymer tracts and SNP calls resulting from apparent rare
variants. 

Our filtered SNP dataset includes 5,113 SNPs, with 4.65 SNPs per kb of
contig sequence. There were 7.95 synonymous SNPs per 1000 synonymous
bases and 2.44 non-synonymous SNPs per 1000 non synonymous bases. A
mean dn/ds of 0.244 was calculated for the 765 TUGs (all highCA
derived contigs) containing at least one synonymous SNP. Positive
selection can be inferred from high dn/ds ratios. Over-represented GO
ontology terms associated with TUGs with dn/ds higher than 0.5 were
identified (Table 4; Additional Figures 4). Within the molecular
function category, ``peptidase activity'' was the most significantly
overrepresented term. The twelve TUGs annotated as peptidases each had
unique orthologs in \textit{C. elegans} and \textit{B. malayi}. Other
overrepresented terms abundant over categories identified subunits of
the respiratory chain: ``heme-copper terminal oxidase activity'' and
``cytochrome-c oxidase activity'' in molecular function and
``mitochondrion'' in cellular compartment (Table 4 and Additional
Figures 4). Contigs identified as novel to clade III and novel in
\textit{A. crassus} had a significantly higher dn/ds than other
contigs (Additional Figure 3).

Signal peptide containing proteins have been shown to have higher
rates of evolution than cytosolic proteins in a number of nematode
species. \textit{A. crassus} TUGs predicted to contain signal peptide
cleavage sites showed a non-significant trend towards higher dn/ds
values than TUGs without signal peptide cleavage sites (p =
0.22; two sided Mann-Whitney-test).

Orthologs of \textit{C. elegans} transcripts with lethal RNAi
phenotype are expected to evolve under stronger selective constraints
and the values of dn/ds showed a non-significant trend towards lower
values in TUGs with orthologs with a lethal phenotype compared to a
non-lethal phenotypes (p=0.815, two-sided
U-test).

The genotypes of single adult nematodes were called using Samtools
\cite{journals/bioinformatics/LiHWFRHMAD09} and Vcftools
\cite{pmid21653522}, and 199 informative sites (where
two alleles were found in at least one assured genotype at least in
one of the nematodes) were identified in 152
contigs. Internal relatedness \cite{pmid11571049}, homozygosity by
loci \cite{pmid17107491} and standardised heterozygosity
\cite{coltman81j} all identified the Taiwanese nematode from
aquaculture (sample T1) as the most and the European nematode from
Poland (sample E2) as the least heterozygous individuals.

The genome-wide representativeness of these 199 SNP
markers for the whole genome in population genetic studies was
confirmed using heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlation
\cite{pmid21565077}: mean internal relatedness = 0.78, lower bound of
95\% confidence intervals from 1000 bootstrap replicates (cil) =
0.444; mean homozygosity by loci = 0.86, cil = 0.596; standardised
heterozygosity = 0.87, cil= 0.632.

 \subsection*{Differential gene expression}
                





Gene expression was inferred by the unique mapping of 252,388
(71.49\%) of the raw reads to the fullest assembly (including the all
assembled contigs as a "filter"; see Table 1). In analysis,
non-\textit{A. crassus} contigs, and all contigs with fewer than 32
reads overall were excluded. Thus 658 TUGs were analysed for
differential expression using ideg6 658 for
normalisation and the statistic of Audic and Claverie
\cite{pmid9331369} for detection of differences. Of these TUGs, 54
showed expression predominantly in the male library, 56 TUGs were more
highly represented in the female library, 56 TUGs were primarily
expressed in the libraries from Taiwan, and 22 TUGs were
overrepresented in the European library.

Overrepresentation of of GO-terms differentially expressed between the
male and female libraries highlighted especially ribosomal proteins
oxidoreductases and collagen processing enzymes as enriched (Table 6a
and Additional Figures 4). Ribosomal proteins were all overexpressed
in the male library, oxidoreductases and collagen processing enzymes
were overexpressed female libraries.

Analysis of overrepresentation of of GO terms associated with TUGs
differentially expressed between male and female libraries identified
ribosomal proteins, oxidoreductases and collagen processing enzyme
terms (Table 6a and Additional Figures 4). The ribosomal proteins were
all overexpressed in the male library, while the oxidoreductases and
collagen processing enzymes were overexpressed female
libraries. Similar analysis of overrepresentation of of GO terms
associated with the TUGs differentially expressed between European
nematodes and Asian nematodes identified several terms of catalytic
activity especially related to metabolism (Table 6b; Additional
Figures 1). TUGs annotated as acyltransferase were upregulated in the
European libraries. However, the expression patterns for other TUGs
with overrepresented terms connected to metabolism did not show
concerted up or down-regulation. Thus for the term ``steroid
biosynthetic process'', 2 TUGs were downregulated and 3 contigs
upregulated in European nematodes. No enrichment of of signal peptide
positive TUGs, of TUG conservation categories, or TUGs with
\textit{C. elegans} orthologs with lethal or non-lethal
RNAi-phenotypes was identified. Significantly elevated dn/ds was found
for TUGs differentially expressed in European versus Asian nematodes
(Fisher's exact test p=0.007; also both up- or downregulated were
significant). TUGs overexpressed in the female libraries showed
elevated levels of dn/ds (Fisher's exact test p=0.041), but contrast
male overexpressed genes showed decreased levels of dn/ds (Fisher's
exact test p=0.014).


\section*{Discussion}

We have generated a de novo transcriptome for \textit{A. crassus} an
important invasive parasite that threatens wild stocks of the European
eel \textit{An. anguilla}. These data will enable a broad spectrum of
molecular research on this ecologically important and evolutionarily
interesting parasite. As \textit{A. crassus} lives in close
association with its host, we used exhaustive filtering to remove all
host-derived, and host-associated organism-derived contamination from
the raw and assembled data.

We generated a transcriptome dataset from the definitive host
\textit{An. japonica} as part of this filtering process. In addition
to eel-derived transcripts, we also removed data apparently derived
from protists, particularly cercozoans, that may have been
co-parasites of the eels sampled.

Similar taxonomic screening of NGS transcrioptome data has been shown
to be important previously \cite{pmid21138572}, particularly in
rejection of hypotheses of horizontal gene transfer into the focal
species \cite{pmid20386959}. We were not able to use base frequency-
and codon usage-based screening to identify contaminant data
\cite{pmid20034392, pmid17218127} because contaminant sequences in our
data derived from multiple genomes.


We used a combined assembly approach \cite{pmid20950480} to generate a
transcriptome estimate that had lower redundancy and higher
completeness. Projects using single assemblers often report
substantially greater numbers of contigs for datasets of similar size
(see e.g. \cite{pmid21364769}). The 3’ bias in the assembly likely
derivesd from the use of oligod(T) in mRNA capture and cDNA synthesis
and bias is near-ubiquitous in deep transcriptome sequencing projects
(e.g.  \cite{pmid20331785}). The final \textit{A. crassus} TUG
assembly (32,418 contig consensuses) spans 12.7 Mb, and thus likely
covers most of the expected span of the transcriptome (the
\textit{C. elegans} transcriptome spans 30 Mb, and the
\textit{B. malayi} transcriptome 14 Mb).

Comparison between free-living and parasitic nematode species can be
used to identify genes that may underpin adaptations for parastism
\cite{parkinson_transcriptomic_2004, wasmuth_extent_2008}. Annotations
were derived for a ~30\% of all, and over 50\% of the highCA
\textit{A. crassus} TUGs using sequence similarity to known
proteins. Domain annotations were derived for 45\% of the highCA TUGs
using InterProScan \cite{pmid11590104}.

Comparison with the complete proteomes of \textit{B. malayi} and
\textit{C. elegans} showed a remarkable degree of congruence in
annotation spectrum in the two parasitic nematodes. This implies that
the \textit{A. crassus} transcriptome is a representative partial
genome \cite{parkinson_partigene--constructing_2004}. Using a
taxonomically-stratified analysis of BLAST similarities, we identified
more \textit{A. crassus} TUGs that apparently arose in the common
ancestor of Nematoda than arose in the last common ancestor of the
Spirina (Clade III). As \textit{A. crassus} is part of a lineage that
arises basally in Spirurina (Clade III), the lack of genes associated
with the all-parasitic nematodes of Clade III may be due to
phylogenetic distance obscuring relationships, particularly if the
genes underpinning parasitism are, as would be expected, rapidly
evolving. TUGs predicted to be part of gene families that arose in the
last common ancestor of Nematoda or to be novel to A. crassus
contained the highest proportion of genes predicted to have secretory
signal peptides. This confirms observations made in a
\textit{Nippostrongylus brasiliensis} \cite{harcus_signal_2004}, where
secreted and surface proteins were less conserved. Analysis of dn/ds
(see below) across conservation categories favors the hypothesis of
rapid evolution in proteins with more restricted phylogenetic origins.

Transcriptome data were generated from multiple individual
\textit{A. crassus} of Taiwanese and European origin. We identified
SNPs both within and between populations, but noted aberrant patterns
in the ratio of transitions to transversions (ti/tv) and the ratio of
non-synonymous SNPs per non-synonymous site to synonymous SNPs per
synonymous site (dn/ds). Screening of SNPs in or adjacent to
homopolymer regions, removing “noise'' associated with common
homopolymer errors \cite{pmid21685085}, improved overall measurements
of SNP quality, increased the ti/tv ratio to more closely resemble
canonical dataset, and resulted in a reduced, credible dn/ds ratio
distribution. The corrected ti/tv value of 1.925 (1.25 outside and
2.39 inside ORFs) is in good agreement with the overall ti/tv of
\textit{Homo sapiens} (2.16 \cite{pmid21169219}) or \textit{Drosophila
  melanogaster} (2.07 \cite{pmid21143862}). The mean dn/ds ratio
decreased with removal of SNPs adjacent to homopolymer regions from
0.45 to 0.244. While interpretation of dn/ds ratios within populations
is not unproblematic \cite{pmid19081788}, the assumption of negative
(purifying) selection on most protein coding genes makes lower mean
values seem more plausible.


We applied a threshold value for the minority allele of 7\% for
exclusion of SNPs, as approximately 10 haploid equivalents were
sampled (5 individual nematodes plus a negligible contribution from
the L2 library and offspring within the adult female nematodes). This
screening reduced non-synonymous SNPs in high coverage TUGs and
removed the dependence of dn/ds on coverage, and removed the need to
control for sampling biased by depth (i.e. coverage; see
\cite{pmid18590545} and \cite{pmid20478048}).

The final dn/ds estimates seem plausible, as \textit{D. melanogaster}
female reproductive tract transcripts have dn/ds of 0.15
\cite{pmid15579698} and a 454 transcriptomic analysis of the parasitic
nematode \textit{Ancylostoma canium} reported dn/ds of 0.3
\cite{pmid20470405}. We used a dn/ds threshold for inference of
positive selection on coding sequence of 0.5 has been suggested as
threshold for assuming positive selection \cite{pmid15579698} and
identified 46 TUGs that may be under positive selection. Twelve of
these TUGs were annotated as peptidases, and the GO term peptidases
was significantly overrepresented in the set of positively selected
TUGs. These twelve peptidases are deeply conserved, as all have unique
orghtologue pairs in \textit{B. malayi} and
\textit{C. elgans}. Peptidases have previously been proposed to have
acquired prominent roles in host-parasite interactions, and an
\textit{A. crassus} trypsin-like proteinase may be utilised by the
tissue-dwelling L3 stage to penetrate host tissue and an aspartyl
proteinase may be a blood meal digestive enzyme in adults
\cite{polzer_identification_1993}.  

The twelve proteinases under positive selection could be targets of
adaptive immunity developed against \textit{A. crassus}
\cite{knopf_migratory_2008, knopf_vaccination_2008}, which is often
only elicited against subtypes of larvae \cite{molnar_caps}.


A set of 199 high-credibility SNPs with high information content for
population genetic studies was identified by genotyping individual
nematodes. The low number of SNPs inferred reflects both the variance
in allele contribution introduced transcriptomic data and the
stringency of software targeted at higher throughput genome sequence
data \cite{pmid21653522x}. Nevertheless, levels of genome-wide
heterozygosity found for the five adult nematodes examined are in
agreement with existing microsattelite data that show reduced
heterozygosity in European populations of \textit{A. crassus}
\cite{wielgoss_population_2008}. The polish female nematode was the
most highly inbred, while the nematode from the wild
\textit{An. japonica} in Taiwan was the most highly outbred.


While the experimental design was not ideal for identification of
differential expression between conditions (due to low replication) we
used methods developed for comparison of cDNA libraries
\cite{pmid9331369} to infer differential gene expression according to
the origin of the sequencing libraries. This approach is widely used
with 454 transcriptome data (e.g. \cite{pmid20470405}).

We can only tentatively infer differential expression of a gene under
different conditions (sex, origin) based on identification of
significantly differential expression between libraries. Genes
over-expressed in the male \textit{A. crassus} included major sperm
proteins [83], and, surprisingly, a suite of ribosomal
proteins. Collagen processing enzymes are were overexpressed in the
female nematodes in line with modulation of collagen synthesis in
nematode larval development, and the ovoviviparity of this species
\cite{pmid10637627}. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase was identified as
overexpressed in European nematodes compared to the Asian
one. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases act in fatty-acid-oxidation in
peroxisomes and mitochondria \cite{pmid4721607}. Together with a
change in steroid metabolism and the enrichment of mitochondrially
localized enzymes these suggest changes in the energy metabolism of
\textit{A. crassus} from different origins. Possible explanations
could include a change to more or less aerobic processes in nematodes
in Europe due to their bigger size and/or increased availability of
nutrients.  TUGs overexpressed in the female libraries showed elevated
levels of dn/ds but genes overexpressed in males had decreased levels
of dn/ds. The first finding is unexpected, as genes overexpressed in
female libraries will also include TUGs related to larval development
(such as the collagen modifying enzymes discussed above), and these
larval transcripts in turn are expected to be under purifying
selection because of pleiotropic effects of genes in early development
\cite{pmid15371532}. The second contrasts with findings that male
specific traits and transcripts often show hallmarks of positive
selection \cite{pmid15795858, pmid11404480}. In \textit{Ancylostoma
  caninum} however, female-specific transcripts showed an enrichment
of “parasitism genes'' \cite{pmid20470405} and a possible explanation
would be a similar enrichment of positively selected parasitism
related genes in our dataset. For males the decreased dn/ds may be
explained by the by the high number of ribosomal protein-encoding
TUGs, which all show very low levels of dn/ds. That these TUGs were
found to be differentially expressed remains puzzling.

Some male-overexpressed TUGs, such as that encoding major sperm
protein, showed elevated dn/ds. It is unlikely that correlation of
differential expression with positive selection results from mapping
artifacts, as all the ribosomal protein encoding TUGs identified
overexpressed in males have very low dn/ds.

Genes differentially expressed according to the geographic origin of
the nematodes showed significantly elevated levels of dn/ds. We
interpret tis as reflecting a correlation between sequence evolution
and phenotypic modification in different host environments or
correlation between sequence evolution and evolution of gene
expression. Whether expression of these genes is modified in different
hosts or evolved rapidly in the contemporary divergence between
European and Asian populations of \textit{A. crassus}, is one focus of
ongoing work building on the reference transcriptome presented
here. For such an analysis it will be important to disentangle the
influence of the host and the nematode population in a common garden,
co-inoculation experiment.

\section*{Conclusions }

The \textit{A. crassus} transcriptome provides a basis for a new era
of molecular research on this ecologically important species. It will
aid not only analysis of the invasive biology of this parasite,
assisting in identifying the origins of invading opopulations as well
as the adaptations that may be being selected in the new European
host, but also in the investigation of the acquisition of parasitism
in the great clade of animal parasites, Spirurina. In particular,
positive selection of proteinases and differences in energy metabolism
between European and Asian \textit{A. crassus} constitute a candidate
phenotype relevant for phenotypic modification or contemporary
divergent evolution as well as for the long term evolution of
parasitism.

\subsection*{Table 5 - Measurements of multi-locus heterozygosity for
  single worms}

Genotyping for a set of 199 SNPs, different
measurements were obtained to asses genome-wide
heterozygosity. Measurements for relative heterozygosity (rel.het;
number of homozygous sites/ number of heterozygous sites), internal
relatedness (int.rel; \cite{pmid11571049}), homozygosity by loci
(ho.loci; \cite{pmid17107491}) and standardized heterozygosity
(std.het; \cite{coltman81j}) are given with the number of SNPs
informative for this library (inform.snp). All these measurements are
pointing to sample T1 (Taiwanese worm from aquaculture) as the most
heterozygous and sample E2 (the European worm from Poland) as the
least heterozygous individual. Heterozygote-heterozygote correlation
\cite{pmid21565077} confirmed the genome-wide significance of these
markers.

\subsection*{Additional Files}

\subsubsection*{Additional text}
The additional text describes the assembly process and evaluation of
assembly quality in further detail. This text also contains figures
and tables.

\subsubsection*{Additional tables}

Additional table 1: 
All data computed on the contig level, including sequences (raw,
coding, imputed, protein) additional table 1 b lists only the metadata
not including sequences.

Additional table 2:
High quality SNPs.

Additional tables 3: 
Contigs differentially expressed between male and
female worms (a) and European and Asian worms (b). Normalised counts
and the natural logarithm of fold changes are given.

\subsubsection*{Additional figures}

Additional Figure 1: 
When SNPs in or adjacent to homopolymeric
regions are removed changes in ti/tv and dn/ds are observed: as the
overall number of SNPs is reduced both ratios change to more plausible
values. Note the reversed axis for dn/ds to plot these lower values to
the right. For homopolymer length $>$ 3 a linear trend for the total
number of SNPs and the two measurements is observed. A width of 11 for
the screening window provides most plausible values (suggesting
specificity) while still incorporating a high number of SNPs
(sensitivity).

Additional Figure 2: 
Overabundance of SNPs at codon-position two (a) and of non-synonymous
SNPs (c) for low percentages of the minority allele. (b) Significant
positive correlation of coverage and dn/ds before removing these SNPs
at a threshold of 7\% ($p<$ 0.001, $R^2=$
0.015) and (d) absence of such a
correlation afterwards ($R^2<$0.001,
$p=$0.192).

Additional Figure 3: Box-plots for dn/ds in TUGs according to
different categories of evolutionary conservation. Significant
comparisons are sequences novel in Metazoa vs. novel in
\textit{A. crassus} (0.009 and 0.002; p-value for bitscore of 50 and
80, Nemenyi-Damico-Wolfe-Dunn test), in Nematoda vs. in
\textit{A. crassus} (0.03 and 0.009). Sequences novel in cladeIII
failed to show significantly elevated dn/ds, despite higher median
values due to the low number of contigs of this category with a dn/ds
obtained.

Additional Figures 4: subgraphs of the GO-ontology categories induced
by the top 10 terms identified as enriched in different sets of
genes. Boxes indicate the 10 most significant terms. Box colour
represents the relative significance, ranging from dark red (most
significant) to light yellow (least significant). In each node the
category-identifier, a (eventually truncated) description of the term,
the significance for enrichment and the number of DE / total number of
annotated gene is given. Black arrows indicate a is ``is-a''
relationship. GO-ontology category and the set of genes analysed for
the enrichment are indicated in each figure.
